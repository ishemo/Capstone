Auburn Tigers
Auburn (SEC) has a record of 25-2 this season. They have a Net Rating of 35.99, ranking 2 overall. Their Offensive Rating (ORtg) is 129.7, ranking 1 in the nation, while their Defensive Rating (DRtg) is 93.7, ranking 11. The team's adjusted tempo (AdjT) is 68.4, indicating their pace of play. Their strength of schedule rating is 16.83, which ranks 2. Additionally, their luck rating is 0.07 (ranked 47).
It has been 14 years since a national champion lost its final two regular-season games and then made a run to the NCAA title (UConn, 2011). Auburn's regular-season finish -- 4-3, including losing the final two games -- still feels like a blip, considering it defeated six top-15 KenPom squads on its way to securing a No. 1 seed and earning "Excellent" ratings on both offense and defense, per Synergy Sports data. Johni Broome (18.6 points per game, 10.6 rebounds per game, 2.6 blocks per game) is the only real competition for Cooper Flagg in the race for the Wooden Award, while Tahaad Pettiford (11.6 PPG, 39% from beyond the arc) is a key player in this 10-man rotation with a fleet of veterans on the roster (for context, Chad Baker-Mazara, 25, is older than Zion Williamson). Bruce Pearl has a serious contender to win the program's first national title. Which teams can challenge Auburn in the South Region?Jay Bilas, Seth Greenberg and Jay Williams discuss which teams in the South Region could give No. 1 overall seed Auburn trouble.
The Tigers might be faded by some as a national title contender after losing three of their last four heading into the tournament, but I still think Auburn's best is as good as anyone in college hoops. The 28-5 Tigers have one of the two best college basketball players in Johni Broome, but for all he does, it's the fact that guard Denver Jones and big man Dylan Cardwell are defensive stalwarts that make Auburn's ceiling so high. Bruce Pearl's team is deep, athletic, rangy, and it's probably about to be one of the more ticked off programs entering the tournament. If that's not enough, this is also the top-ranked offense at KenPom. Keep in mind, Auburn was upset in the first round last year against No. 13 Yale. The Tigers don't need to look far to find the proper motivation tactics to push toward the second Final Four in school history, the other coming 2019 under Pearl. No team has lost three of its last four going into the NCAA Tournament and gone on to win the whole thing.

Duke Blue Devils
Duke (ACC) has a record of 24-3 this season. They have a Net Rating of 38.18, ranking 1 overall. Their Offensive Rating (ORtg) is 128.6, ranking 2 in the nation, while their Defensive Rating (DRtg) is 90.4, ranking 4. The team's adjusted tempo (AdjT) is 65.8, indicating their pace of play. Their strength of schedule rating is 9.22, which ranks 53. Additionally, their luck rating is -0.04 (ranked 286).
Jon Scheyer has gone against the grain in today's era and found a way to win with one of America's youngest teams. Led by Wooden Award favorite Cooper Flagg, the young Blue Devils could make a run to the national championship 10 years after a collection of freshmen under Mike Krzyzewski last cut down the nets for the program -- assuming Flagg is healthy after he missed most of the ACC tournament with an ankle injury. Key defensive contributor Maliq Brown could miss significant time with a shoulder injury, too. The road to the 2025 national title begins with Flagg, one of the most complete players in recent college basketball history. He's the offensive leader on a roster that starts three freshmen (Flagg, Kon Knueppel and Khaman Maluach). He also anchors one of the best defensive units in the sport, ranked fourth in adjusted defensive efficiency on KenPom. Duke finished the regular season on a 19-1 run after Flagg turned 18 years old Dec. 21. It also has a win over Auburn. These Blue Devils are special.
The most talented team in the sport and the No. 1 choice in most advanced metrics. The only team in this bracket with 31 wins. This is an easy pick in terms of which team is the best, but that guarantees nothing when it comes to what will happen over the next 1-3 weeks. The Blue Devils are a No. 1 seed for the first time since 2019 when they featured Zion Williamson. This year's team has college basketball's biggest star since Zion, Cooper Flagg, who isn't expected to be held back in the tournament by the ankle sprain he suffered in the ACC quarterfinals. Flagg (18.9 ppg, 7.5 rpg, 4.1 apg) is arguably the National Player of the Year, but he's flanked by a squad with gobs of potential. Kon Knueppel (14.4 ppg) is a terrific Robin to Flagg's Batman, while junior guard Tyrese Proctor has been somewhat quietly ultra-dependable all season long. Duke ranks top-five in adjusted offensive and defensive efficiency at KenPom -- the only team who qualifies for that distinction. Jon Scheyer had two really good teams in his first two seasons, but this one, in Year 3, is capital-G Great. If they play to their ceiling, the Blue Devils will win it all. This tournament doesn't care much about those things, though, so nothing is guaranteed.

Houston Cougars
Houston (B12) has a record of 24-4 this season. They have a Net Rating of 35.78, ranking 3 overall. Their Offensive Rating (ORtg) is 125.1, ranking 7 in the nation, while their Defensive Rating (DRtg) is 89.3, ranking 3. The team's adjusted tempo (AdjT) is 61.0, indicating their pace of play. Their strength of schedule rating is 12.16, which ranks 26. Additionally, their luck rating is -0.015 (ranked 221).
It's no surprise Houston is a contender again. In the past five seasons under Kelvin Sampson, the program has made it as far as the Final Four, the Elite Eight and the Sweet 16 (the other three times). But this is the best offensive group of Cougars that Sampson has coached. Ranked 10th in adjusted offensive efficiency on KenPom, they now have the scorers they lacked in past years, including L.J. Cryer (43% from beyond the arc), who averaged 18.0 PPG in the final 12 games of the regular season. The offensive uptick has also turned the Cougars into an elite squad in transition (rated "Excellent," per Synergy Sports data). This Houston squad, which finished 19-1 in the Big 12 and lost just one regular-season game after Nov. 30, is Sampson's best shot at his first national title, assuming J'Wan Roberts (who missed the last two games with an ankle injury) is available and Milos Uzan (25 points in the Big 12 tournament title game) continues to excel.
Houston does have a No. 1 ranking from one spot; Torvik has kept the Cougars at the top of the sport much of the past two months. The only top seed from last year's tournament that's also a No. 1 this year. And it's the third straight Big Dance Houston's on the top line. The Cougars are as reliable as pretty much anything going in college basketball. Kelvin Sampson's team held opponents to 50 points or fewer nine times this season, tops in the nation. This group is also the deadliest 3-point-shooting team BY FAR; Sampson's ever had. Three guards, LJ Cryer, Milos Uzan, Emanuel Sharp all shot above 40%. Houston ranks fourth nationally in 3-point shooting at 39.8%. So there's that in addition to a vintage Coogs defense, which is No. 2 in KenPom and has one of the premier defenders in Joseph Tugler. We await to see how held back center J'Wan Roberts will be with his ankle injury, but it speaks to Houston's culture that, even without him, this team has a claim to top-five status. The Cougars were held back from a Final Four run last season when Jamal Shead got injured in the Sweet 16. If this team is fully healthy, it can easily atone for that over the next two weeks.

Florida Gators
Florida (SEC) has a record of 24-3 this season. They have a Net Rating of 34.16, ranking 4 overall. Their Offensive Rating (ORtg) is 127.0, ranking 4 in the nation, while their Defensive Rating (DRtg) is 92.9, ranking 7. The team's adjusted tempo (AdjT) is 68.9, indicating their pace of play. Their strength of schedule rating is 10.77, which ranks 43. Additionally, their luck rating is 0.011 (ranked 158).
During the offseason, coach Todd Golden made a key decision that positioned the Gators to win their first national championship since back-to-back crowns in 2006 and 2007. He moved Walter Clayton Jr. (17.3 PPG, 4.4 APG, 1.3 SPG, 37% from the 3-point line) to point guard. As a result, the third-best offense in adjusted efficiency, according to KenPom, has averaged 84.8 points this season. That's a top-10 mark. The Gators also finished second in defensive efficiency in the SEC behind Tennessee. They went 3-1 against Tennessee (1-1), Auburn (1-0) and Alabama (1-0) in the regular season, and Clayton's supporting cast -- Will Richard, Alex Condon and Florida Atlantic transfer Alijah Martin, all of whom are averaging double figures -- is one of the best in the country. There are no doubts about Florida's title aspirations.
Take every game into account over the past five weeks and I think you can make the case that no team has played better than Florida. Todd Golden's Gators are an absolute force. The trio of Walter Clayton Jr., Alijah Martin and Will Richard is the best backcourt triumvirate in college basketball. That's not what makes Florida so good, though. The reason the Gators can win a national title is how they cover so much of the floor and adapt to every opponent, every style, no matter what. The 6-11 Alex Condon might be the nation's most underrated player. Thomas Haugh is a 6-9 sophomore with an ORtg of 132.9 and could be the best sixth man in college hoops. And Florida got back 7-1 Micah Handlogten a few weeks back after a broken leg ended his season prior to last year's NCAA Tournament. This is Florida's best team in more than a decade and a bona fide title threat. Golden has never won an NCAA Tournament game. How many does he pick up in 2025: three, four or more?

Michigan State Spartans
Michigan St. (B10) has a record of 22-5 this season. They have a Net Rating of 26.08, ranking 10 overall. Their Offensive Rating (ORtg) is 119.9, ranking 23 in the nation, while their Defensive Rating (DRtg) is 93.9, ranking 12. The team's adjusted tempo (AdjT) is 67.5, indicating their pace of play. Their strength of schedule rating is 10.78, which ranks 41. Additionally, their luck rating is -0.016 (ranked 224).
Ready to feel old? Twenty-five years ago, Jason Richardson was a bright-eyed freshman on the 2000 Michigan State team that won the Big Ten's last national title. This year, his son Jase Richardson is arguably the best player for his father's former coach, Tom Izzo. The rising star averaged 16.8 PPG in the final nine games of the regular season and is the only NBA prospect (No. 30 in ESPN's latest mock draft) on the roster. Only one player on this squad was a top-20 prospect in high school (Xavier Booker). But Izzo loves these gritty Spartans, who aren't great offensively (they're shooting 30.2% from beyond the arc) but are one of the five best defensive teams in the country -- an asset that helped them secure the Big Ten regular-season championship outright following a seven-game winning streak.
From unranked in the preseason to one of the best teams in college basketball. Tom Izzo told me recently he's got a team that's the most well-connected group he's had in five years. That's reflected in how well this team shares the ball, how good it is in finding each other and knowing how to attack in transition and how hard it bounds to the tin on both ends. The one issue is 3-point shooting -- MSU's one of the worst teams from deep in this field. If it can overcome that, it's in the mix to win four-plus games in this field. Jase Richardson is the freshman who has emerged as the go-to guy, but he's far from the only player who can do damage. Balance is the formula here.

Alabama Crimson Tide
Alabama (SEC) has a record of 22-5 this season. They have a Net Rating of 28.17, ranking 6 overall. Their Offensive Rating (ORtg) is 127.1, ranking 3 in the nation, while their Defensive Rating (DRtg) is 98.9, ranking 45. The team's adjusted tempo (AdjT) is 74.7, indicating their pace of play. Their strength of schedule rating is 16.85, which ranks 1. Additionally, their luck rating is 0.052 (ranked 73).
The Tide enter the NCAA tournament a week removed from a last-second road victory over rival Auburn in the regular-season finale. Alabama needed that boost, after snapping a seven-game winning streak in mid-February and going 3-4 to end the regular season. A shaky Alabama defense also surrendered at least 85 points in 11 of its regular-season games. Consider, however, the opposition in that 3-4 stretch: losses to Auburn, Missouri, Tennessee and Florida, but wins over Kentucky, Mississippi State and Auburn. All NCAA tournament teams. Also consider that this is a group, led by Mark Sears (19.2 PPG, 5.0 APG), that plays at the fastest pace in America and maintains a top-five ranking in adjusted offensive efficiency. That's not easy to do, and few squads are equipped to stop it, but Grant Nelson suffered an injury in the SEC tournament that might impact his playing time going forward.
The nation's top-scoring team for the second straight season. Alabama (91.1 ppg) flies up and down the floor, but it's also blown some games it should have won and been rocked by a couple of good teams as well. I'd put the Tide on my list of teams that can win a national title -- provided the defense is steady. Mark Sears has, as expected, been among the best guards in college basketball. Averaging 18.7 points and 4.9 assists, he's at the center of Nate Oats' program. But if Bama is going to live up to my ranking here, Grant Nelson's health is key. As of publishing time, we don't know how severe or not Nelson's knee injury was in the loss to Florida in the SEC semis. He's the Tide's second-best player, and yet, this is a team with six guys averaging double figures, so the good news is Bama won't be searching for bodies to pile up the points.

Tennessee Volunteers
Tennessee (SEC) has a record of 22-5 this season. They have a Net Rating of 31.56, ranking 5 overall. Their Offensive Rating (ORtg) is 119.1, ranking 29 in the nation, while their Defensive Rating (DRtg) is 87.6, ranking 1. The team's adjusted tempo (AdjT) is 64.0, indicating their pace of play. Their strength of schedule rating is 13.32, which ranks 15. Additionally, their luck rating is 0.013 (ranked 152).
At its worst this season, Tennessee lost by 30 points to Florida. But at its best, it beat that same Florida team by 20 a month later. For a fifth straight year, the Vols will enter the tournament with an elite defense. Ranked first in adjusted defensive efficiency on KenPom, they've held 12 regular-season opponents to under 60 points. The team that lost Dalton Knecht, last season's SEC Player of the Year who led UT to the Elite Eight, found a way to bounce back thanks to Zakai Zeigler's improved performance (13.1 PPG, 7.5 APG, 1.9 SPG) and the addition of transfers Chaz Lanier (17.9 PPG, 41% from beyond the arc) and Igor Milicic Jr. (10.2 PPG, 7.3 RPG). There are retirement rumors floating around about coach Rick Barnes. If this is the end for him, he could author a magical finish with this group.
Rick Barnes' Vols are really, really good once more, logging a high-end seed for the fifth straight tournament. With a defense that's as rugged and resistant as essentially any in the sport (and there are some really good ones), the Vols have national title potential. Senior point guard Zakai Ziegler has been a mainstay in Knoxville; he's on the short list of the most stronghearted guards you'll find. And he's a great defender. I love watching him play and will miss him in college hoops when he's gone. Another premier Vol is Jahmai Mashack, a senior wing who could be the best all-around defensive menace college basketball has to offer. Last year's Vols made the Elite Eight and fell to Purdue. This group is slightly better on offense and defense. Can Rick Barnes make the second Final Four of his career? The answer is yes. Tennessee is unquestionably good enough to win at least four games in this tournament.

St. John's Red Storm
St. John's (BE) has a record of 24-4 this season. They have a Net Rating of 25.28, ranking 13 overall. Their Offensive Rating (ORtg) is 114.0, ranking 73 in the nation, while their Defensive Rating (DRtg) is 88.8, ranking 2. The team's adjusted tempo (AdjT) is 70.2, indicating their pace of play. Their strength of schedule rating is 8.0, which ranks 64. Additionally, their luck rating is -0.035 (ranked 273).
Earlier this month, St. John's made an appearance on "The Tonight Show" with Jimmy Fallon after capturing the Big East regular-season championship for the first time since 1992. Rick Pitino, who has been followed all year by Vice TV cameras for a reality show, has helped turn a team anchored by 6-foot-7 forward RJ Luis Jr. (18.1 PPG, 7.1 RPG, 1.4 SPG) into a national title threat. The Storm don't have all of the traits of a typical national title contender, with a subpar offense that shoots just 29.9% from 3. That said, the Johnnies have a top-three defense nationally. Their profile is similar to that of Louisville's in 2012 (31.8% from the 3-point line, best defense in America) and 2013 (33% from the 3-point line, best defense in America) -- coincidentally, teams that Pitino led to the Final Four and national championship, respectively.
The story coming out of Queens is maybe the best in college basketball. Rick Pitino needed all of two seasons to bring about one of the best years in the history of St. John's. This is St. John's first NCAA Tournament since 2019. The program hasn't won a game in this event in 25 years, but that will be ending in just a few days. At 30-4, SJU is a national title threat thanks to claiming the nation's top-rated defense. Its four losses came by a combined seven points, making the Johnnies the sixth power-conference team since 1996 to enter the NCAA tourney without a loss by more than three points. Three of those teams -- 2014-15 Kentucky, 2004-05 Illinois, 1998-99 Duke -- made the national championship game. This team is led by Big East POY RJ Luis (18.4 ppg, 7.2 rpg), but if you've seen SJU play a bit, you know big man Zuby Ejifior is the guy who makes the Red Storm so powerful. And Kadary Richmond is one of the better all-around defenders in the country. A remarkable team that's extremely hard to beat. And it's the sixth school Pitino has brought to the Dance, which is an NCAA record.

Iowa State Cyclones
Iowa St. (B12) has a record of 21-6 this season. They have a Net Rating of 26.78, ranking 8 overall. Their Offensive Rating (ORtg) is 120.3, ranking 21 in the nation, while their Defensive Rating (DRtg) is 93.5, ranking 9. The team's adjusted tempo (AdjT) is 68.8, indicating their pace of play. Their strength of schedule rating is 10.77, which ranks 42. Additionally, their luck rating is -0.009 (ranked 201).
The best version of Iowa State started the season 15-1, with a 5-0 tally in Big 12 action. Curtis Jones (17.0 PPG, 37% from beyond the arc), Keshon Gilbert (13.8 PPG, 4.3 RPG) and Milan Momcilovic (11.0 PPG, 40.2% from 3) were having breakout seasons and Tamin Lipsey, an all-Big 12 first-team selection a year ago, lent a steady veteran presence. But things have changed. Gilbert is dealing with a muscle strain that could impact him in the postseason. The Cyclones, who once owned a top-15 mark in adjusted offensive efficiency, slipped to 69th overall after Jan. 15 and through the end of the regular season. They ended the regular season 8-7 while also committing turnovers on one-fifth of their possessions. That's a lot. The truth is, projecting the ceiling for the current version of Iowa State, which exited the Big 12 tournament in the quarterfinal, is a gamble.
The Cyclones were one of the three best teams through the first half of the season, starting 15-1 (that only loss to Auburn in Maui), but have gone 9-8 since. Some of it is injury-related, but the offense has dropped off from what it was in the first three weeks of the season. TJ Otzelberger's team is still top-20 good with the ball and top-10 level defending it. Had Keshon Gilbert been in good shape health-wise, this team would be capable of making the Final Four. Gilbert and Curtis Jones are really good wings who put up 30-plus points collectively; 6-8 wing Milan Momcilovic is the team's best deep threat (40.6% from 3). NOTE: Iowa State was moved down in the rankings after the first time of publish once it was revealed Gilbert would not be available in the NCAA Tournament. 

Wisconsin Badgers
Wisconsin (B10) has a record of 21-6 this season. They have a Net Rating of 26.56, ranking 9 overall. Their Offensive Rating (ORtg) is 124.8, ranking 8 in the nation, while their Defensive Rating (DRtg) is 98.2, ranking 38. The team's adjusted tempo (AdjT) is 67.5, indicating their pace of play. Their strength of schedule rating is 12.42, which ranks 22. Additionally, their luck rating is -0.037 (ranked 275).
A year ago, John Tonje suffered a foot injury that cost him the majority of his single season at Missouri. It contributed to the Tigers' 19-game losing streak to end the 2023-24 campaign. Then he transferred to Wisconsin. And this season, the 6-5 star has put up numbers (18.9 PPG, 5.1 RPG, 38% from the 3-point line) to earn All-America consideration on a Wisconsin squad that has played the fastest pace (153rd in adjusted tempo on KenPom) of the Greg Gard era while maintaining its poise (17th nationally in turnover rate). Granted, the Badgers had an easy schedule, facing top Big Ten teams Michigan and Michigan State just once, and despite wins over Purdue, Arizona and Illinois they finished the regular season losing three of five games. They can soar in the postseason, but only if Tonje can take them there. He shot just 38% from inside the arc in Wisconsin's regular-season losses.
The Naismith Coach of the Year finalists list included 10 names, all worthy candidates. The best one not to make the cut: Badgers coach Greg Gard. Bucky had a lot of good players leave in the portal last season, and yet this team is noticeably better than the group that earned a No. 5 seed in 2024. The best is a two-time transfer, John Tonje, who has played near or at an All-American level for the past four months. Wisconsin is good enough to make the Final Four with the right draw, the biggest reason being that Gard's never had an offense this good in his 10 years on the job.

Kentucky Wildcats
Kentucky (SEC) has a record of 18-9 this season. They have a Net Rating of 24.81, ranking 16 overall. Their Offensive Rating (ORtg) is 126.0, ranking 5 in the nation, while their Defensive Rating (DRtg) is 101.2, ranking 62. The team's adjusted tempo (AdjT) is 70.7, indicating their pace of play. Their strength of schedule rating is 16.15, which ranks 3. Additionally, their luck rating is -0.03 (ranked 262).
Entering the SEC tournament, Kentucky had defeated eight AP top-15 teams this season, tied for a program record. It's a remarkable accomplishment for Mark Pope -- the former team captain of the 1996 national championship Wildcats -- in his first season as head coach of the same Wildcats. It's also noteworthy because Kentucky's year has been marred by injuries, including a season-ending wrist injury for Jaxson Robinson. Only four players have participated in all 31 regular-season games. But the return of Lamont Butler (11.9 PPG, 4.4 APG) from a shoulder injury late in the season changed the team's trajectory. The Wildcats, who'd been shaky defensively all year, became a top-40 team in that respect with his return (he's ranked the 17th-most-impactful player in the country by EvanMiya), which is why the injury he suffered that sidelined him again in the SEC tournament is so concerning. Otega Oweh (16.2 PPG) remains a reliable threat and Koby Brea (44% from 3) is a sharpshooter. Kentucky might be short-handed, but it still has a high ceiling.
The WIldcats had eight top-15 wins this season, and I'd have Mark Pope's group even higher if they were healthy. But with Lamont Butler's shoulder a lingering concern and Jaxson Robinson now out for the season (wrist), in addition to not having Kerr Kriisa since December, there's a ceiling on this group. That said, Pope's done a wonderful job in his first year at his alma mater. Kentucky scores 85.3 points per game, and that's led by one of the most surprisingly great transfers this season: Otega Oweh. The former Oklahoma Sooner leads UK at 16.2 per night, followed by Butler and Koby Brea averaging 11.5. Kentucky's spotty defense cost this team a few times in big spots this season, but it's a lot better than where it was in mid-January. With the style of play and the camaraderie on the court, UK is a threat to make the second weekend -- but it also could be vulnerable to a first-round upset. A lot's on the table with this group, which makes them fun to watch.

Texas Tech Red Raiders
Texas Tech (B12) has a record of 21-7 this season. They have a Net Rating of 27.03, ranking 7 overall. Their Offensive Rating (ORtg) is 123.9, ranking 10 in the nation, while their Defensive Rating (DRtg) is 96.9, ranking 27. The team's adjusted tempo (AdjT) is 65.9, indicating their pace of play. Their strength of schedule rating is 9.35, which ranks 51. Additionally, their luck rating is -0.058 (ranked 313).
Texas Tech has had one of the best seasons in America. The Red Raiders finished second in the Big 12. They were also the only Big 12 squad to beat Houston (82-81 in overtime) on the road. From Jan. 1 through the end of the regular season, they were ranked 10th in adjusted offensive efficiency and 21st in adjusted defensive efficiency, according to BartTorvik.com. They also made 37% of their shots from beyond the arc. They're legit. And JT Toppin (18.1 PPG, 9.3 RPG, 1.2 BPG) is their superstar, who hasn't gotten the same attention as some of the other All-America contenders in college basketball. Lubbock's brightest talent could very well go viral if he leads Texas Tech to its second Final Four in six years.
Don't be startled in seeing Grant McCasland's Red Raiders ranked this high. TTU has clocked in as a top-10 team in the metrics for about six weeks at this point. Tech has a top-10 adjusted offensive efficiency and averages 81 points per outing. The star is JT Toppin, who was in this tournament a year ago at New Mexico. With the Red Raiders, he's been an All American-level player: 18.1 points, 9.2 rebounds per night. Though Toppin's the topper, Darrion Williams, Chance McMillian, Christian Anderson and Elijah Hawkins (the point guard at the front of it all) combine to create the most underrated starting five in college basketball. The lads from Lubbock are plenty capable of making it back to their home state and playing in San Antonio for the Final Four.

Texas A&M Aggies
Texas A&M (SEC) has a record of 20-7 this season. They have a Net Rating of 23.97, ranking 20 overall. Their Offensive Rating (ORtg) is 116.4, ranking 52 in the nation, while their Defensive Rating (DRtg) is 92.4, ranking 6. The team's adjusted tempo (AdjT) is 66.4, indicating their pace of play. Their strength of schedule rating is 14.78, which ranks 7. Additionally, their luck rating is 0.027 (ranked 117).
The Aggies are proof of the SEC's historic strength. Competing in a league that broke the Big East's previous record for bids (11) on Selection Sunday, Buzz Williams guided his squad to an 11-7 SEC record, which included four straight losses but also wins against Auburn and LSU to end the regular season. The nation's top offensive rebounding team has been good against nonconference opponents, too, with wins over Ohio State, Creighton, Texas Tech and Purdue. Although lukewarm offensive groups like the Aggies (sub-40 in adjusted offensive efficiency) struggle to make deep runs in the NCAA tournament, it helps that Wade Taylor IV (15.2 PPG) & Co. are also a top-10 defensive team.
No team shoots the ball more poorly yet is better overall than Buzz Wiliams' Texas A&M Aggies. This squad ranks 274th in free-throw percentage, 293rd from 2-point range and 317th from beyond the arc. It's not good at the No. 1 objective of the game: putting the ball in the basket. An easy team to pick for an early upset. So how'd it go 22-10 and beat the likes of Purdue, Creighton, Texas Tech and Auburn? Nobody is better at grabbing offensive rebounds and producing second-, third- and fourth-chance opportunities like these guys. A&M snags 42% of its misses. If Wade Taylor IV (15.7 ppg) and Zhuric Phelps (14.1 ppg) are on, this is a dangerous team.

Arizona Wildcats
Arizona (B12) has a record of 18-9 this season. They have a Net Rating of 25.66, ranking 12 overall. Their Offensive Rating (ORtg) is 120.7, ranking 19 in the nation, while their Defensive Rating (DRtg) is 95.0, ranking 19. The team's adjusted tempo (AdjT) is 70.4, indicating their pace of play. Their strength of schedule rating is 14.45, which ranks 8. Additionally, their luck rating is -0.055 (ranked 308).
Welcome to college basketball's most confusing miniseries. At the beginning of the year, the Wildcats were 4-5 -- although those five losses came against NCAA tournament teams (Wisconsin, West Virginia, Oklahoma, UCLA, Duke). They found themselves again and rattled off 13 wins in 14 games to sail to the top of their new conference, the Big 12. It didn't last. Caleb Love (16.4 PPG, 4.2 RPG, 3.5 APG) and his teammates lost five of their final eight regular-season games. In that slump, they were one of the worst defensive teams from a major conference (92nd in adjusted defensive efficiency) and they also made just 29% of their 3s, per BartTorvik.com. Those late-season struggles have cost Arizona the momentum it craved entering the dance.
The Wildcats have had a parabolic-type season: started 4-5, then went 13-1, now 5-6 in their last 11. They rank anywhere from ninth to 14th in mainstream predictive metrics. Sometimes I see this group and think it's Final Four-good. Other times Arizona looks eminently beatable against most teams in this field. Tommy Lloyd has two Sweet 16 appearances and a first-round knockout in his three previous showings with Arizona. Anything is on the table here. At 16.6 points per game, Caleb Love is in his swan song as a college player. He's been pretty good this season, flanked by two guys who will ultimately determine how far Arizona goes: sophomore guard KJ Lewis (10.9 ppg) and junior guard Jaden Bradley (11.8 ppg).

Purdue Boilermakers
Purdue (B10) has a record of 19-9 this season. They have a Net Rating of 24.38, ranking 17 overall. Their Offensive Rating (ORtg) is 123.8, ranking 11 in the nation, while their Defensive Rating (DRtg) is 99.4, ranking 51. The team's adjusted tempo (AdjT) is 65.4, indicating their pace of play. Their strength of schedule rating is 15.38, which ranks 4. Additionally, their luck rating is -0.01 (ranked 206).
The Boilermakers lost two-time Wooden Award winner Zach Edey off a squad that lost to Connecticut in the national championship game last season. Few teams immediately bounce back under those circumstances. But the Boilermakers might be equipped for it -- if they can erase the memory of a late-season slide. Braden Smith, the Big Ten Player of the Year, is one of the best guards in the country and Trey Kaufman-Renn (19.7 PPG) has done an admirable job filling the void created by Edey's absence. And yet, Purdue's defense has suffered. What was one of the best defenses in the country last year ended the 2024-25 regular season winning just two of seven games and fell to 159th in adjusted defensive efficiency per BartTorvik.com. The sloppy finish has reduced some of the optimism about the Boilermakers' dreams, but their early-season victory over Alabama has also proved the Boilermakers can play with any team in the country.
No more Zach Edey, but Purdue's still a good team with a great head coach and an All-American. That would be Braden Smith, who was one of the three best guards in the country this season. Averaging 16.1 points, 8.7 assists, 4.6 rebounds and 2.2 steals, Smith is sometimes dismissed for reasons similar to his former teammate. Edey couldn't be great because he was that tall. Smith can't be great because he's too short. The haters are exhausting. Just say you don't know ball! Trey Kaufman-Renn is Purdue's leading scorer (20.2 ppg) on a team that is top-10 in offensive efficiency, top-10 in 3-point percentage and won 22 games with one of the 10 hardest schedules in college hoops.

Maryland Terrapins
Maryland (B10) has a record of 21-6 this season. They have a Net Rating of 25.11, ranking 15 overall. Their Offensive Rating (ORtg) is 120.9, ranking 16 in the nation, while their Defensive Rating (DRtg) is 95.8, ranking 21. The team's adjusted tempo (AdjT) is 70.1, indicating their pace of play. Their strength of schedule rating is 7.97, which ranks 66. Additionally, their luck rating is -0.029 (ranked 259).
If you're looking for a Final Four sleeper, you've found one. Freshman Derik Queen (15.7 PPG, 9.2 RPG), a projected lottery draft pick with an old-school game, and Julian Reese (13.2 PPG, 9.3 RPG), the brother of WNBA standout Angel Reese, lead a team that won 11 of 13 games to end the regular season. The Terps also went 39% from 3 in that stretch. They're a strong squad that found a rhythm late, which isn't unusual when you consider they were starting a true freshman and three transfers. If point guard Ja'Kobi Gillespie can limit his turnovers, he can help the team with the ninth-best adjusted defensive efficiency make its first Final Four appearance since 2002, the year the Terps also won their first and only national championship.
The Terps are good enough to get to San Antonio. This team had four losses total in the past two months and all of them came on game-winning shots in the final 10 seconds. Maryland's "Crab Five" centers around dazzling freshman Derik Queen (16.3 ppg, 9.0 rpg). He's a crafty, must-see player who easily ranks among the five best frosh in college hoops. Terps vet Julian Reese helps Queen hold down the frontcourt with guards Ja'Kobi Gillespie (14.7 ppg), Rodney Rice (13.9) and Selton Miguel (12.0 ppg) rounding out one of the most reliable quintets you'll see in this tournament. Kevin Willard's group is among the strongest on defense you'll find; I think the Terps are underrated in this regard. This is Maryland's best seed in a decade, and I can't wait to watch them play.

Michigan Wolverines
Michigan (B10) has a record of 21-6 this season. They have a Net Rating of 22.83, ranking 22 overall. Their Offensive Rating (ORtg) is 117.6, ranking 39 in the nation, while their Defensive Rating (DRtg) is 94.7, ranking 15. The team's adjusted tempo (AdjT) is 69.8, indicating their pace of play. Their strength of schedule rating is 12.61, which ranks 20. Additionally, their luck rating is 0.06 (ranked 63).
Even Vladislav Goldin (16.7 PPG, 6.7 RPG, 1.7 BPG) and Danny Wolf (12.9 PPG, 9.7 RPG, 1.4 BPG) did not think a pairing of two 7-footers -- who together run pick-and-roll action and lead the Michigan offense -- would work at first. The Wolverines quickly became one of the most balanced teams in the country and a Big Ten title contender, sitting at 20-5 overall and 12-2 in conference play Feb. 16, before their season took a turn in the final three weeks of the regular season and they went from top 40 to sub-230 in adjusted offensive efficiency, making just 22% of their 3-point attempts. Still, they played like a team capable of winning multiple games in March for much of the season. And they have a unique scheme with Wolf and Goldin -- both All-Big Ten second-team selections -- who will create problems for most opponents.
What a debut in Ann Arbor for Dusty May. The Wolverines regathered some of their mojo in the Big Ten Tournament and enter the NCAA field with one of the best inside-the-arc attacks in college basketball. That's because Michigan is the only team to start/play two 7-footers more than 27 minutes per game. Vlad Goldin came with May via FAU and is the team's leading scorer, while Yale transfer Danny Wolf is one of the most skilled players in college basketball. May's team is deep, but it has big troubles with turnovers. Solve that, and a Final Four is on the table. Also: Michigan won 12 games this season by four points or fewer; it's the only power-conference team in college basketball history to do that.

Oregon Ducks
Oregon (B10) has a record of 20-8 this season. They have a Net Rating of 18.78, ranking 34 overall. Their Offensive Rating (ORtg) is 117.8, ranking 35 in the nation, while their Defensive Rating (DRtg) is 99.0, ranking 47. The team's adjusted tempo (AdjT) is 68.0, indicating their pace of play. Their strength of schedule rating is 13.91, which ranks 12. Additionally, their luck rating is 0.089 (ranked 29).
Dana Altman's team had an odd first season in the Big Ten, finishing 10th in offensive efficiency and ninth in defensive efficiency within the league, but still managing to finish 12-8 in conference play. The Ducks' introduction did come with a few privileges: They played Michigan, Michigan State, Wisconsin, Illinois and Maryland only one time each, helping them carry a seven-game winning streak into the Big Ten tournament. And while the Ducks don't have many sexy metrics, they did have the wins to warrant a solid seed, including over Alabama and Texas A&M. Ultimately, the Ducks successfully navigated one of the country's best conferences and rallied down the stretch -- do what you want with that information.
This is Dana Altman's 18th trip to the NCAA Tournament, 10th with the Ducks, who had won eight straight before getting clipped in the Big Ten quarters by Michigan State. Intriguing team. Started 16-3, lost five straight but has been steady for the most part since. It's not outstanding in any statistical category, but having one of the oldest Power Five rosters has clearly been a major plus. Two names to know for different reasons: Senior PF Nate Bittle (13.9) looks 30 and plays like a vet. Fun game. Even more fun: 6-foot sophomore Jackson Shelstad, who has accumulated a handful of deep-range game-winners and game-tying shots in his time with the Ducks. Would love to see the ball in his hands in a tie game and 20 seconds to go later this week.

Clemson Tigers
Clemson (ACC) has a record of 22-5 this season. They have a Net Rating of 23.99, ranking 19 overall. Their Offensive Rating (ORtg) is 120.8, ranking 17 in the nation, while their Defensive Rating (DRtg) is 96.8, ranking 25. The team's adjusted tempo (AdjT) is 63.7, indicating their pace of play. Their strength of schedule rating is 8.05, which ranks 63. Additionally, their luck rating is -0.03 (ranked 260).
Brad Brownell is now the ACC's elder statesman, with Leonard Hamilton announcing his resignation earlier this season. For years, Brownell was at the center of hot seat rumors, but he signed a five-year contract worth $20 million after taking the Tigers to the Elite Eight last season. He no longer has veterans Joe Girard III and PJ Hall (now in the G League), but successfully hit the reset button through bigger roles for returnees Chase Hunter (16.0 PPG, 41% shooting from beyond the arc) and Ian Schieffelin (12.9 PPG, 9.3 RPG) as well as key contributions from transfers Viktor Lakhin (11.6 PPG, 6.4 RPG, 38% from 3) and Jaeden Zackery (11.3 PPG). Clemson won 14 of its final 15 regular-season games, including a win over Duke.
Brad Brownell's been at Clemson for 15 seasons. This is his fifth time taking the Tigers dancing but the first in back-to-back years. The 2023-24 group made the Elite Eight -- and this team rates slightly better. After going 18-2 in the ACC, Clemson set a school record with 27 wins, the best single-season victory total in the history of the program. One issue: guard Dillon Hunter has a broken left hand, which hurts their backcourt depth. Hunter was the team's sixth man. Another Hunter, Chase, averages 16.4 points and is shooting 41.2% from 3. He gets help by way of some stellar defense from backcourt mate Jaeden Zackery, who's among the best on-ball defenders in the league. I'm also a bit of a sucker for senior F Ian Schieffelin's game. A signature Really Good College Basketball Player.

Memphis Tigers
Memphis (Amer) has a record of 22-5 this season. They have a Net Rating of 16.5, ranking 46 overall. Their Offensive Rating (ORtg) is 114.9, ranking 61 in the nation, while their Defensive Rating (DRtg) is 98.4, ranking 41. The team's adjusted tempo (AdjT) is 70.5, indicating their pace of play. Their strength of schedule rating is 7.69, which ranks 67. Additionally, their luck rating is 0.079 (ranked 38).
Penny Hardaway had an eventful preseason -- he built a new staff after dismissing multiple assistants, an anonymous letter alleging major NCAA violations was sent to the school and customized shoes were stolen from his porch -- but the drama didn't follow the Tigers into the season. Led by American Athletic Conference Player of the Year PJ Haggerty and all-AAC first-team selection Tyrese Hunter, this group has given Hardaway his best chance in seven seasons at the helm to lead this program to the second weekend of the NCAA tournament for the first time since 2009. (But erase all of this if Hunter, who was in a boot after suffering an injury in the AAC tournament semifinals, is unavailable to play this week.) As a player, Hardaway was the leader of a Memphis team that reached the Elite Eight -- and this squad arguably has that potential. The Tigers have star power, a respectable top-50 defense and a bunch of shooters (39% from beyond the arc, No. 6 in the country). They could again make history with Hardaway, the AAC's Coach of the Year.
Penny Hardaway's Tigers have never entered the tournament with a better record -- or seed. The interesting part: Despite winning more than 80% of its games, Memphis hasn't been a metrics darling. It's got a backcourt I love: PJ Haggerty and Tyrese Hunter have serious shot-taking/making capabilities, giving Memphis its best scoring guard tandem in years. The Tigers have hovered most of the season in the top 10 in 3-point accuracy, and their list of victims reflects how high Memphis' ceiling is: Michigan State, Ole Miss, UConn, Clemson and Missouri have all been felled by this team. A real headache to play on short prep, too.

Ole Miss Rebels
Mississippi (SEC) has a record of 19-8 this season. They have a Net Rating of 22.71, ranking 23 overall. Their Offensive Rating (ORtg) is 117.7, ranking 36 in the nation, while their Defensive Rating (DRtg) is 95.0, ranking 18. The team's adjusted tempo (AdjT) is 68.2, indicating their pace of play. Their strength of schedule rating is 12.48, which ranks 21. Additionally, their luck rating is -0.032 (ranked 267).
The Rebels are top 30 in offense and defense entering their first NCAA tournament appearance since 2019. But there are concerns. They have one of the smaller teams in the field. And "there aren't enough ball-dominant players in this lineup," according to EvanMiya.com. "This lineup may struggle to create offense." The 84th-ranked team in scoring (77.8 PPG) has dealt with offensive droughts, but it has also compensated with a careful approach to every possession. Ole Miss is ranked third nationally in turnover percentage (8.9 per game). It has wins over BYU, Louisville, Alabama, Kentucky and Tennessee this season. And Chris Beard's starting lineup of Jaylen Murray, Matthew Murrell, Dre Davis, Malik Dia and Sean Pedulla has an "A-minus" grade on defense, and a "B-plus" grade overall, on EvanMiya.com.
The Rebels are back in the field for the first time since 2019. Chris Beard's team is 22-11 with wins over Louisville, BYU, Alabama, Kentucky and Tennessee. This team is among the best nationally at not turning itself over, giving the Rebs 3-5 more fulfilled possessions per game than their counterparts most nights. Sean Pedulla hit a game-winner vs. Arkansas in the SEC second round that reminded us of why he's been one of the best transfers in the league. Pedulla leads the team in scoring, but the attack across the board is fairly balanced. No doubt capable of reaching the Sweet 16.

BYU Cougars
BYU (B12) has a record of 19-8 this season. They have a Net Rating of 21.39, ranking 27 overall. Their Offensive Rating (ORtg) is 123.1, ranking 12 in the nation, while their Defensive Rating (DRtg) is 101.8, ranking 69. The team's adjusted tempo (AdjT) is 67.0, indicating their pace of play. Their strength of schedule rating is 8.9, which ranks 56. Additionally, their luck rating is 0.001 (ranked 179).
The Cougars aren't waiting for the arrival of A.J. Dybantsa -- the No. 1 recruit of the 2025 class, who reportedly signed an $8.5 million NIL deal -- to pursue a national title. In Kevin Young's first season at the helm, the former Phoenix Suns assistant has successfully molded a program that has emerged as one of the country's best over the past month: Between Feb. 11 and Thursday, when BYU beat Iowa State in the Big 12 tournament quarterfinals, the Cougars had the No. 1 offense at BartTorvik.com with 61.2% shooting from inside the arc and 39.2% from beyond it. All-Big 12 first-team honoree Richie Saunders (16.0 PPG, 44% from 3) led this late-season surge, while the 6-9 Egor Demin (10.8 PPG, 5.6 APG) has grown more comfortable running point.
The Cougars will remain a chic Sweet 16/Elite Eight pick, even after getting decked in the Big 12 semis by Houston. (Houston does this to most teams.) Few teams share the sugar like this one; nine players average between 6.0 and 16.0 points. They take really smart shots and run some creative sets. Kevin Young spent more than a decade on an NBA sideline as an assistant coach, and he's adapted quite well quite quickly to the college game, overseeing BYU's 24-9 season. If the Cougars win their next game, they'll have their most wins in nine seasons -- and their first second round NCAA trip in 14.

Illinois Fighting Illini
Illinois (B10) has a record of 17-11 this season. They have a Net Rating of 22.31, ranking 25 overall. Their Offensive Rating (ORtg) is 120.7, ranking 18 in the nation, while their Defensive Rating (DRtg) is 98.4, ranking 42. The team's adjusted tempo (AdjT) is 72.0, indicating their pace of play. Their strength of schedule rating is 15.18, which ranks 5. Additionally, their luck rating is -0.045 (ranked 295).
Illinois lost every key player from a group that made a run to the Elite Eight last season, including AP All-America third-team selection Terrence Shannon Jr. Yet, Brad Underwood put together another top-15 offensive unit that also actually plays better defense (40th in adjusted defensive efficiency on KenPom). This year's star is Kasparas Jakucionis (15.5 PPG, 5.5 RPG, 4.7 APG), a 6-6 guard who is a projected lottery draft pick. Will Riley, a 6-8 forward, is a projected first-round pick, too. A late-season four-game winning streak that ended in the Big Ten quarterfinal has coincided with the return of Morez Johnson Jr. (7.1 PPG, 6.6 RPG) from a wrist injury that sidelined him for five games in February and March. But Underwood's squad is healthy and connected at the right time.
The 21-12 Illini are the choose-your-own-adventure team of the tournament. Capable of getting rolled in the first round, or good enough to get hot and win three games and threaten a Final Four. But it's hard to remove just how badly they got romped by Maryland in the Big Ten quarters (88-65). If you've got a top-10 NBA pick running your offense, you've got a chance for some March magic. Illini freshman Kasparas Jakucionis is a 6-6 guard out of Lithuania who has shown flashes of great while too often settling for good. The same can be said of center Tomislav Ivisic and forward Tre White. A streaky 3-point shooting team, the Illini will have to win shooting big and running plenty.

Missouri Tigers
Missouri (SEC) has a record of 20-7 this season. They have a Net Rating of 25.24, ranking 14 overall. Their Offensive Rating (ORtg) is 125.1, ranking 6 in the nation, while their Defensive Rating (DRtg) is 99.8, ranking 53. The team's adjusted tempo (AdjT) is 68.3, indicating their pace of play. Their strength of schedule rating is 10.18, which ranks 46. Additionally, their luck rating is -0.013 (ranked 212).
Missouri's 19-game losing streak to end the 2023-24 season now makes more sense. John Tonje, who is an All-America candidate at Wisconsin, was injured for most of his one season at Missouri. Caleb Grill (13.8 PPG, 40% from the arc) also missed most of last season due to injury. He's back, the rest of the team has been healthy, and Dennis Gates has orchestrated one of the greatest turnarounds in recent college basketball history. Grill, Duke transfer Mark Mitchell (14.1 PPG, 4.6 RPG) and Iowa transfer Tony Perkins (8.6 PPG) have anchored one of America's best offensive teams (fifth in adjusted offensive efficiency) and helped this squad reach the NCAA tournament for the second time in three years. Wins over Kansas, Alabama and Florida were pivotal. Grill, Anthony Robinson and Tamar Bates all endured the losing streak a year ago and could have left but they didn't. And they've been rewarded for that decision.
A team like Mizzou really displays the unprecedented depth of the SEC. This is a 22-11 team that's easily in the top 20 of most metrics. The Tigers didn't have power forward Mark Mitchell available in the SEC Tournament; his availability in the NCAA Tournament is paramount to making a Sweet 16 (or better) push. Mitchell (14.1 ppg) is Mizzou's leading scorer. Dennis Gates' offense is top-five good in the country thanks to shooting 37% from 3-point range, 56.7% from 2 and getting to the foul line more often than every other team in this tournament. And oh, by the way, this team is a record-setter. Missouri went winless last season vs. league competition. It's only the third high-major team to bounce back from going O-fer in its league to make the NCAAs, and it's the best seed in that regard as well.

Marquette Golden Eagles
Marquette (BE) has a record of 20-7 this season. They have a Net Rating of 21.32, ranking 28 overall. Their Offensive Rating (ORtg) is 118.1, ranking 31 in the nation, while their Defensive Rating (DRtg) is 96.8, ranking 24. The team's adjusted tempo (AdjT) is 67.5, indicating their pace of play. Their strength of schedule rating is 10.91, which ranks 39. Additionally, their luck rating is 0.008 (ranked 161).
You can look at Marquette's 4-6 record over the last 10 regular-season games from one of two perspectives: Either the Golden Eagles hit a wall entering the toughest stretch of their schedule, with four matchups against St. John's and UConn -- or their weaknesses that could impact them in the NCAA tournament were exposed. This group has similarities to the Marquette teams that captured No. 2 seeds in the past two NCAA tournaments: It forces a lot of turnovers while not committing many itself, and it is efficient on offense (55% from inside the arc). It also doesn't hurt that the Golden Eagles are led by an All-America candidate in Kam Jones (19.2 PPG, 6.0 RPG). But it's worth noting that, entering the Big East tournament, this version of the Golden Eagles hadn't defeated a top-50 KenPom team since Jan. 3 -- and earlier statement wins over Wisconsin, Purdue and Maryland happened before Christmas.
Few players in this tournament can take over a game like MU senior guard Kam Jones. The crafty lefty averages 19.3 points, 5.9 assists and 4.5 rebounds. His 3-point shooting isn't great (31.2%), but so much else he brings to the court gives Marquette (23-10) a puncher's chance against a lot of teams. David Joplin and Chase Ross flank Jones in Marquette's offensive attack; senior Stevie Mitchell is one of the 10 best defenders in the nation, too. This is Shaka Smart's fourth season at Marquette and his fourth tourney appearance. The Golden Eagles are now a mainstay in this event with Smart running the show.

Saint Mary's Gaels
Saint Mary's (WCC) has a record of 25-4 this season. They have a Net Rating of 24.24, ranking 18 overall. Their Offensive Rating (ORtg) is 117.7, ranking 37 in the nation, while their Defensive Rating (DRtg) is 93.5, ranking 8. The team's adjusted tempo (AdjT) is 62.3, indicating their pace of play. Their strength of schedule rating is 5.02, which ranks 87. Additionally, their luck rating is 0.004 (ranked 170).
Now in his 24th season, West Coast Conference Coach of the Year Randy Bennett will aim to lead the WCC regular-season champions to the second weekend of the NCAA tournament for the first time since 2010. The Gaels' top-15 defense will help, as will the trio that carried them to a 17-1 conference record: WCC Player of the Year Augustas Marciulionis (14.3 PPG, 6.1 APG), WCC Defensive Player of the Year Mitchell Saxen (10.6 PPG, 7.9 RPG) and WCC Sixth Man of the Year Mikey Lewis (8.5 PPG, 39% from beyond the arc).
The Gaels are dancing for the 11th time under Randy Bennett and making their fourth straight appearance overall. SMC played its way to a 28-5 as regular-season champs of the WCC by playing its signature rugged defense, in addition to being a beast on the boards. The Gaels snare 40.5% of their misses, good for the second-best rate in the country. Point guard Augustus Marciulionis is a fun floor general, buoyed down low by the 1-2 big-man rotation of Mitchell Saxen and Harry Wessels.

UCLA Bruins
UCLA (B10) has a record of 20-8 this season. They have a Net Rating of 21.7, ranking 26 overall. Their Offensive Rating (ORtg) is 116.3, ranking 53 in the nation, while their Defensive Rating (DRtg) is 94.7, ranking 14. The team's adjusted tempo (AdjT) is 65.0, indicating their pace of play. Their strength of schedule rating is 10.95, which ranks 37. Additionally, their luck rating is -0.007 (ranked 194).
After falling to Michigan State at home en route to a 2-4 start to its first season in the Big Ten, Mick Cronin controversially called his team "soft." But the Bruins responded with the resilience Cronin craved after a four-game losing streak in early January, winning 11 of their next 14 games to close the regular season and play their way into the NCAA tournament. Their résumé includes wins over Oregon, Arizona, Wisconsin, Gonzaga and Michigan State. And the Bruins rank inside the top 20 in adjusted defensive efficiency, forcing turnovers on nearly one-quarter of their opponents' possessions this season. Tyler Bilodeau leads the team in scoring with 41% shooting from beyond the arc, while Kobe Johnson -- brother of Atlanta Hawks standout Jalen Johnson -- is the Bruins' defensive star (1.7 SPG).
The Bruins are in the field for the fourth time in the past five years. At 22-10, they're a bit all over the place, but they do excel at turning teams over. Oregon State transfer Tyler Bilodeau is the key piece for Mick Cronin's guys. This team doesn't have a clear forte or Achilles' heel. From a national perspective, UCLA is a bit bland, though I will say Bilodeau (6-foot-9) and 6-8 Eric Dailey's joint 3-point shooting capability does create some mismatch opportunities. You can make the case for them at 21 or 22 ... or as low as 32/33. I'm splitting the difference.

Kansas Jayhawks
Kansas (B12) has a record of 19-9 this season. They have a Net Rating of 23.52, ranking 21 overall. Their Offensive Rating (ORtg) is 115.3, ranking 57 in the nation, while their Defensive Rating (DRtg) is 91.8, ranking 5. The team's adjusted tempo (AdjT) is 68.8, indicating their pace of play. Their strength of schedule rating is 13.47, which ranks 13. Additionally, their luck rating is -0.009 (ranked 203).
This is one of the most perplexing teams Bill Self has coached in Lawrence. The Jayhawks have all of the talent any coach would covet. Hunter Dickinson (17.6 PPG, 10.0 RPG, 1.3 BPG) should earn his third AP All-America spot. Veterans Dajuan Harris Jr. and KJ Adams Jr. were members of the 2022 national title team. Zeke Mayo, AJ Storr and Rylan Griffen were three of the top available transfers in the offseason. The preseason No. 1 team picked to win the Big 12 had a promising start featuring wins over Duke and Michigan State. But Kansas (60th in adjusted offensive efficiency since Feb. 1) ultimately finished sixth in the standings and lost to Arizona in the Big 12 tournament quarterfinals, falling short of its ceiling. On paper, this is a national championship contender. But if you've watched Kansas at all this season, the Jayhawks look as disconnected as any edition out of Lawrence in recent memory.
The Jayhawks are 20-game winners for a 26th straight season (a D-I record), but the preseason No. 1 team has been all over the map for four months. This Jayhawks team will nevertheless try to buck the trend. Kansas has never made the Sweet 16 in the same season as earning the preseason No. 1 ranking. It's the last go-round for Hunter Dickinson, Dajuan Harris Jr. and KJ Adams. Bill Self's defense still ranks in the top 15 and KU has a 41.3% 3-point shooter in South Dakota State transfer Zeke Mayo. Can the NCAA Tournament give this team a new lease on its season, or is it fated to follow its pattern of skittish play from most of the past few months?

Louisville Cardinals
Louisville (ACC) has a record of 21-6 this season. They have a Net Rating of 22.68, ranking 24 overall. Their Offensive Rating (ORtg) is 120.1, ranking 22 in the nation, while their Defensive Rating (DRtg) is 97.4, ranking 31. The team's adjusted tempo (AdjT) is 68.8, indicating their pace of play. Their strength of schedule rating is 9.88, which ranks 48. Additionally, their luck rating is 0.04 (ranked 95).
After Kenny Payne was fired following last season's 8-24 finish, Louisville brass sought a new coach with the energy to restore the program and galvanize the fan base. It found the right person in Pat Kelsey, who spent the summer roaming the campus and urging students to come back to the YUM! Center to support the team. By the end of the year, the arena was packed, backing a Louisville team that entered the ACC tournament with a 19-1 record in its previous 20 games. Star Chucky Hepburn, an all-ACC first team selection this season, has also enjoyed a turnaround (9.2 PPG at Wisconsin last season; 16.4 PPG at Louisville this year), while the Cardinals have sported a top-30 offense and defense all season -- balance that has fueled a tie for second place in the ACC standings behind Duke, just a year after they finished last.
What a debut for Pat Kelsey. He takes over a Louisville program that was an utter disaster and pulls off one of the greatest year-over-year flips ever. From eight wins to 27. The Cardinals went 20-3 vs. ACC opponents with two of those losses coming against Duke. Kelsey's team gets its defensive toughness from Wisconsin transfer Chucky Hepburn, who's been an All American-level player the past four months. On offense, Terrence Edwards Jr. is a high-usage player who can get hot in a flash. I knocked Louisville down ever so slightly here because Reyne Smith's ankle injury remains a wait-and-see on his availability and productivity. He's the Cards' best 3-point shooter (38.3% on 277 attempts).

Mississippi State Bulldogs
Mississippi St. (SEC) has a record of 19-8 this season. They have a Net Rating of 21.17, ranking 29 overall. Their Offensive Rating (ORtg) is 119.4, ranking 25 in the nation, while their Defensive Rating (DRtg) is 98.2, ranking 39. The team's adjusted tempo (AdjT) is 68.0, indicating their pace of play. Their strength of schedule rating is 14.0, which ranks 11. Additionally, their luck rating is 0.038 (ranked 99).
Chris Jans has led Mississippi State to its third consecutive NCAA tournament for the first time since the early 2000s, when the program earned an invitation every year between the 2001-2002 and 2004-05 seasons. The Bulldogs don't have any spectacular wins on their résumé, but they have All-SEC second-team selection Josh Hubbard, from whom they will need a major effort after finishing 8-10 in SEC play. He proved he is equipped for a starring role, averaging 17.3 PPG in those eight SEC victories. Another exceptional performance from Hubbard, who has scored 25 or more points in six games this season, could position the Bulldogs for their first NCAA tournament win since 2008.
If you think this is just another plodding Bulldogs team that's a bit of a bore to watch, you've got it all wrong. Chris Jans' 21-12 team averages 79.8 points and has a 5-11 dynamo named Josh Hubbard who launches 9.2 3-pointers per game. Playing in the stacked SEC has led to consistency issues. MSU last won at least three games in a row on Jan. 7. That said, I think getting out of SEC play could do this team wonders.

Gonzaga Bulldogs
Gonzaga (WCC) has a record of 21-8 this season. They have a Net Rating of 26.03, ranking 11 overall. Their Offensive Rating (ORtg) is 124.7, ranking 9 in the nation, while their Defensive Rating (DRtg) is 98.7, ranking 44. The team's adjusted tempo (AdjT) is 70.0, indicating their pace of play. Their strength of schedule rating is 5.42, which ranks 79. Additionally, their luck rating is -0.1 (ranked 353).
A lot of this is familiar for the Zags. They won their 20th WCC tournament championship under Mark Few. They did it against rival Saint Mary's -- which had swept them in the regular season. What is not familiar is their path to the NCAA tournament. The Bulldogs were just 4-6 against top-50 KenPom teams this season. Three of those victories, against Baylor, Indiana and San Diego State, happened in November. The Zags have had few impressive moments since. Gonzaga just hasn't resembled a legitimate national title contender. Working in its favor however are 58% 2-point shooting (a top-15 mark nationally) and a top-30 defense. It clearly has the personnel -- Nolan Hickman, Graham Ike and Ryan Nembhard are all-WCC first-team selections -- but hasn't enjoyed the dominance of past iterations. This is, frankly, a difficult team to assess.
For the 20th time in the past 25 years, Mark Few's Bulldogs (25-8) are the WCC Tournament champions. They're shooting for a 10th consecutive Sweet 16 run, which, if it happens, would only trail UCLA's run of 14 from 1967-80 (never in a 64-team field) and UNC's more impressive streak from 1981-93. The Zags have one of the better college point guards of the past 10 years in Ryan Nembhard, who leads the nation in assists (9.8 per game). Graham Ike down low is a threat to get 20 every night. It's been an up-and-down season for GU, but this team ranks top-10 in predictive metrics and will strike fear in every opponent it meets in the bracket.

UConn Huskies
Connecticut (BE) has a record of 18-9 this season. They have a Net Rating of 17.5, ranking 38 overall. Their Offensive Rating (ORtg) is 121.2, ranking 15 in the nation, while their Defensive Rating (DRtg) is 103.7, ranking 99. The team's adjusted tempo (AdjT) is 64.4, indicating their pace of play. Their strength of schedule rating is 9.93, which ranks 47. Additionally, their luck rating is -0.028 (ranked 257).
UConn has been one of the wildest TV dramas of the season. The back-to-back national champions endured surprising losses, injuries and outbursts from head coach Dan Hurley -- and that was all just during November's Maui Invitational. The Huskies' pursuit of a third consecutive title, which no team has won since John Wooden's UCLA squads in the 1960s and 1970s, has been complicated by a massive drop in defensive efficiency: UConn fell from inside the top 10 in championship seasons into the 80s after losing multiple players to the 2024 NBA draft. It has seen improvement since the return of NBA draft prospect Liam McNeeley (14.5 PPG) from injury Feb. 7, with opponents connecting on just 46% of their shots inside the arc over the past five weeks (35th in the country). With sophomore Solo Ball (14.7 PPG) and veteran Alex Karaban (14.6 PPG) also in the mix, UConn's three-peat dream has not died yet.
At the start of the season, there was talk and hope and could-they-really-do-this speculation about a UConn three-peat. Now the Huskies are trying to make a Sweet 16 push and end this up-and-down season on a solid note. At 23-10, Dan Hurley's team has shown it still has the capability to beat good teams: Gonzaga, Marquette (twice) and a road win over Creighton prove that. But it's also lost to Seton Hall (still baffling), Colorado and Dayton. Their hopes don't merely rest on the play of junior forward Alex Karaban (14.4 ppg). Sophomore Solo Ball (14.6 ppg) and freshman Liam McNeeley (14.5 ppg) have to round out the attack on offense. Even with their inconsistencies, the Huskies and Hurley remain compelling TV.

Creighton Bluejays
Creighton (BE) has a record of 19-8 this season. They have a Net Rating of 19.57, ranking 32 overall. Their Offensive Rating (ORtg) is 116.8, ranking 47 in the nation, while their Defensive Rating (DRtg) is 97.2, ranking 29. The team's adjusted tempo (AdjT) is 68.3, indicating their pace of play. Their strength of schedule rating is 11.57, which ranks 32. Additionally, their luck rating is 0.025 (ranked 121).
Big East Defensive Player of the Year Ryan Kalkbrenner (19.8 PPG, 9.0 RPG, 2.7 BPG) matched Patrick Ewing as the only other player to win the award four times, also passing the former Georgetown star in career blocks in conference play (248 to 247). After the team lost Pop Isaacs to a season-ending knee injury hours after he had scored 27 points in a Dec. 4 win over Kansas, Kalkbrenner and Steven Ashworth (16.5 PPG, 7.0 APG) stabilized a Creighton team that regrouped to secure Doug McDermott's fifth consecutive NCAA tournament appearance. Rick Pitino deserved his Big East Coach of the Year honors, but McDermott's rally -- a year after losing his top-two scorers from a Sweet 16 team and months after his most promising transfer suffered a major injury eight games into this season -- is also noteworthy.
As has been the case in recent seasons, Creighton is a quality team that lacks depth but puts out one of the sturdiest starting fives you'll find. It starts with Ryan Kalkbrenner, one of the best defenders in college hoops. Kalkbrenner leads Creighton in scoring (19.4), rebounding (8.8) and blocks (2.7) per game. You have to account for him every second on the floor because of his size and touch. And, he rarely fouls. Senior point guard Steven Ashworth (16.3 ppg) is the No. 2 option on a 24-win team that fouled less frequently than any other team in college basketball. The Jays run a sophisticated offense. The common refrain in the NCAA tourney is "it's all about matchups," and few teams meet that description better than this one.

Baylor Bears
Baylor (B12) has a record of 16-11 this season. They have a Net Rating of 20.64, ranking 30 overall. Their Offensive Rating (ORtg) is 122.2, ranking 13 in the nation, while their Defensive Rating (DRtg) is 101.6, ranking 65. The team's adjusted tempo (AdjT) is 65.3, indicating their pace of play. Their strength of schedule rating is 15.15, which ranks 6. Additionally, their luck rating is -0.04 (ranked 287).
On paper, the Bears have it all this season. It just hasn't worked as expected. VJ Edgecombe is a projected top-five pick in the upcoming NBA draft; the freshman just hasn't been able to lift this team out of its valley. Jeremy Roach transferred to Baylor after a strong run with Duke; he has dealt with injuries and has also been inconsistent. (No longer a starter, he scored just seven points in the Bears' final two regular-season games.) The Bears have an abundance of talent on their roster. Norchad Omier (15.6 PPG, 10.7 RPG) is an all-Big 12 first-team selection, and Robert Wright III (11.7 PPG, 4.5 APG) joins Edgecombe on the all-Big 12 freshman squad. They also have an early-season victory over St. John's. Still, they finished 10-10 in the Big 12 and snuck into the Dance.
Scott Drew's team has a roster that is more talented than its 19-14 record suggests. Its resume was actually fairly dicey but clearly had enough to get past the finish line. This feels like the type of team that's a great candidate to peel off a Sweet 16. Norchad Omier (15.9 ppg, 10.9 rpg) is a hoss down low, VJ Edgecombe (15.0 ppg) could be one of the five most talented freshmen in the sport with fellow first-year guard Robert Wright III (11.3 ppg) emerging as a reliable presence in the back half of the season. The Bears have battled the injury bug all season long. They have a coach who's won a national championship. Will the offense pop this week the way it did back in November?

Georgia Bulldogs
Georgia (SEC) has a record of 16-11 this season. They have a Net Rating of 16.7, ranking 45 overall. Their Offensive Rating (ORtg) is 114.5, ranking 66 in the nation, while their Defensive Rating (DRtg) is 97.8, ranking 35. The team's adjusted tempo (AdjT) is 66.4, indicating their pace of play. Their strength of schedule rating is 11.7, which ranks 31. Additionally, their luck rating is -0.021 (ranked 242).
Asa Newell (15.1 PPG, 6.5 RPG) is just 19 years old, but he has displayed a maturity that has allowed him to excel in America's toughest conference. The 6-11 forward is a projected first-round draft pick for a reason. He's a capable finisher at all spots on the court and he's rated as an "Excellent" offensive performer (against man, against zone, in transition) and a "Very good" defender, per Synergy Sports data. He has been the catalyst for a Georgia team that beat St. John's, Kentucky and Florida this season and won its final four games before falling to Oklahoma in the first round of the SEC tournament. During that winning streak, the Bulldogs were the No. 2 team in America on BartTorvik.com. It appears Georgia has peaked at the right time to secure its first NCAA tournament appearance in a decade.
The drought is finally over in Athens. Georgia is back in the big bracket for the first time since 2015. Mike White, in Year 3, has a 20-12 team with a potential top-10 pick on the roster. Asa Newell averages 15.3 points, 6.9 rebounds and can fluctuate between finesse and bruising with some bodies in the paint. I really like Silas Demary Jr.'s game. The 6-5 wing has two-way ability, can score from all three levels and seems to be the barometer for UGA's outcomes on a given night. The major issue is turnovers. If they can keep them under 10 or 11, they're a threat to beat most teams outside the top 10 ... and even then, Georgia owns wins over Florida and Kentucky.

Oklahoma Sooners
Oklahoma (SEC) has a record of 17-10 this season. They have a Net Rating of 16.13, ranking 49 overall. Their Offensive Rating (ORtg) is 118.1, ranking 33 in the nation, while their Defensive Rating (DRtg) is 101.9, ranking 73. The team's adjusted tempo (AdjT) is 68.6, indicating their pace of play. Their strength of schedule rating is 11.94, which ranks 29. Additionally, their luck rating is 0.032 (ranked 109).
Oklahoma picked a tough year to join the SEC, but it has still found a way to remain competitive, thanks to Jeremiah Fears, a projected top-10 draft pick. Yet, despite the presence of a lottery pick and quality nonconference wins over Arizona, Louisville and Michigan, the Sooners finished 6-12 in the SEC and needed their season-ending victory over rival (and fellow bubble team) Texas to seal the program's first NCAA tournament appearance since 2021. That's how tough the SEC has been this season: The Sooners had a defense that was ranked 14th in the 16-team SEC. Is Oklahoma a good team in a great conference or just an average team that got a few good wins earlier this year? We might find out soon.
Porter Moser gets the Sooners into the NCAAs for the first time in this his fourth season in Norman. Look up and down this list and you'll see a lot of teams with must-see players. If forced to whittle such a list to 10 guys, OU freshman freshman guard Jeremiah Fears is on that list. He averages 17.0 points, 4.1 rebounds and 4.1 assists and has gone to another level over the past two weeks. Arizona, Louisville, Michigan, Missouri -- they've all lost to this group. A vexing team at times, but I like its chances to wind up in a close one later this week.

New Mexico Lobos
New Mexico (MWC) has a record of 22-5 this season. They have a Net Rating of 17.56, ranking 37 overall. Their Offensive Rating (ORtg) is 114.4, ranking 68 in the nation, while their Defensive Rating (DRtg) is 96.8, ranking 26. The team's adjusted tempo (AdjT) is 73.0, indicating their pace of play. Their strength of schedule rating is 5.99, which ranks 75. Additionally, their luck rating is 0.017 (ranked 139).
Rick Pitino wasn't the only member of his family to win an award this season -- his son, Richard Pitino, won Mountain West Coach of the Year after leading the Lobos to their first regular-season conference title since 2013 and first NCAA tournament appearance in a decade. And he did it despite losing Jamal Mashburn Jr. (22.0 PPG at Temple) and JT Toppin (18.4 PPG, 9.3 RPG, 1.3 BPG at Texas Tech) to the transfer portal in the offseason. Mountain West Player of the Year Donovan Dent (20.2 PPG) and Nelly Junior Joseph (13.8 PPG, 11.3 RPG, 1.6 BPG) were the returning sparks the Lobos needed for a 26-7 campaign that featured six wins against top-50 KenPom teams. They also own the conference's top defense and are top 20 in adjusted defensive efficiency nationally.
Richard Pitino's got the Lobos program in back-to-back Big Dances for the first time since 2014. Last year's team earned an 11-seed and was one-and-done. This group is better, despite losing key pieces, thanks to one of the best guards in America. Donovan Dent has left his mark over the previous 30-plus games, emerging as one of the few guys in the sport who's good to average better than 20 points and six dimes. Pitino's team is a group of track athletes, logging approximately 73 possessions per game and constantly looking for the quick (but good) shot. Dent's down-low counterpart used to play for his father: former Iona Gael Nelly Junior Joseph is an elite defensive rebounder.

Vanderbilt Commodores
Vanderbilt (SEC) has a record of 18-9 this season. They have a Net Rating of 16.72, ranking 44 overall. Their Offensive Rating (ORtg) is 118.7, ranking 30 in the nation, while their Defensive Rating (DRtg) is 102.0, ranking 74. The team's adjusted tempo (AdjT) is 69.3, indicating their pace of play. Their strength of schedule rating is 10.96, which ranks 36. Additionally, their luck rating is 0.037 (ranked 101).
Mark Byington's team did not do itself any favors with its loss to Texas in the first round of the SEC tournament. The Commodores also lacked any signature nonconference wins, though their league slate gave them opportunities to boost their résumé with victories (against Tennessee, Kentucky and Missouri) that few bubble teams could match to earn a trip to their first NCAA tournament since 2017. But their chances to advance beyond the opening weekend depend on a few factors. Can they improve their SEC-worst defense? Can they win if they don't get prolific output from Jason Edwards (17.0 PPG)? And will turnovers continue to be a problem, with AJ Hoggard committing one on one-fifth of his possessions this season? There seem to be more questions than answers.
A year ago, Mark Byington had a team on this list. It was James Madison, which wound up winning a game in the first round over Wisconsin. Now he's done the near-unthinkable and delivered the Commodores to the NCAA Tournament. Vandy went 20-12, the 'Dores breaking on through to the other side of the NCAAs for the first time since 2017. North Texas transfer Jason Edwards leads the team in scoring (17.0 ppg), but Tyler Nickel is also one to watch. The guy worth five can give you 3: Nickel averages a team-best 40.6% from deep on six attempts per game.

Utah State Aggies
Utah St. (MWC) has a record of 24-4 this season. They have a Net Rating of 17.0, ranking 42 overall. Their Offensive Rating (ORtg) is 121.8, ranking 14 in the nation, while their Defensive Rating (DRtg) is 104.9, ranking 114. The team's adjusted tempo (AdjT) is 68.3, indicating their pace of play. Their strength of schedule rating is 4.55, which ranks 92. Additionally, their luck rating is 0.091 (ranked 27).
Every team in the country has been forced to rebuild its program year after year in the turbulent climate created by the transfer portal and NIL. It's a more difficult task for the mid-majors, which often lose their best players to the power conferences. Jerrod Calhoun has found a way to keep succeeding. He has led Utah State to its third consecutive NCAA tournament appearance in his first season in Logan. It's a quick recovery for a group that lost former head coach Danny Sprinkle and 2023-24 Mountain West Player of the Year Great Osobor, among others, from those tournament teams. But returnees Ian Martinez (16.9 PPG, 38% from 3) and Mason Falslev (14.7 PPG, 41.5% from 3) helped this team win its first 10 games as one of the top offensive units in America (16th in adjusted offensive efficiency on KenPom). Considering the challenges most first-year coaches face, Utah State's journey to the Big Dance has impressed.
The Aggies are in the NCAA Tournament for the third time in as many years with as many coaches. From Ryan Odom to Danny Sprinkle to, now, Jerrod Calhoun. This team started 16-1 and finished 26-7. It ranks top-20 at KenPom in offensive efficiency with senior shooting guard Ian Martinez acting as the tip of the spear. These Aggies win with creative sets and know how to find good shots from all over the floor. If you want a true, true Elite Eight dark horse, this is the team.

Arkansas Razorbacks
Arkansas (SEC) has a record of 16-11 this season. They have a Net Rating of 17.92, ranking 36 overall. Their Offensive Rating (ORtg) is 113.0, ranking 80 in the nation, while their Defensive Rating (DRtg) is 95.1, ranking 20. The team's adjusted tempo (AdjT) is 69.1, indicating their pace of play. Their strength of schedule rating is 12.66, which ranks 17. Additionally, their luck rating is -0.038 (ranked 283).
John Calipari's move from Kentucky to Arkansas was, by far, the biggest offseason story in college basketball. Equipped with one of the largest NIL budgets in the country, he assembled a team full of five-star prospects and elite transfers such as Johnell Davis, who led Florida Atlantic to the Final Four in 2023. But early injuries decimated the roster to the point the team couldn't hold full practices before the season began. It lost Boogie Fland to a season-ending thumb injury in January (although Fland will reportedly try to play in the NCAA tournament after a miraculous recovery), and Adou Thiero has been dealing with a knee injury (they are the Hogs' top two scorers). As a result, the Razorbacks had a bumpy ride, going 8-10 in the SEC -- just sufficient to keep them in bubble territory. Despite making the tournament, the consensus is that Arkansas has, thus far, failed to meet expectations after one of the top coaches of the era accepted this job.
John Calipari's first season in Hog red includes a bumpy road to the NCAAs, but he's here, even in spite of losing his two leading scorers (power forward Adou Thiero and combo guard Boogie Fland). The Razorbacks will go as far as their backcourt of Johnnel Davis (previously of FAU) and DJ Wagner (who followed Calipari from Kentucky) will take them. Lack of depth has held this team back all season. Will it mean a quick exit? Calipari is 2-7 in his last nine postseason games.

San Diego State Aztecs
San Diego St. (MWC) has a record of 18-7 this season. They have a Net Rating of 16.75, ranking 43 overall. Their Offensive Rating (ORtg) is 110.4, ranking 119 in the nation, while their Defensive Rating (DRtg) is 93.6, ranking 10. The team's adjusted tempo (AdjT) is 66.0, indicating their pace of play. Their strength of schedule rating is 8.11, which ranks 62. Additionally, their luck rating is 0.012 (ranked 157).
In a 73-70 overtime loss to San Diego State in the Players Era Festival in Las Vegas in November, Houston made 46% of its 3-point attempts and collected 41% of its second-chance opportunities. Normally, those kinds of numbers work in a team's favor. Not that time. San Diego State forced 12 turnovers and corralled the Cougars, allowing them just 32% shooting from inside the arc, their lowest mark of this season. That's how good this Aztecs defense can be. Behind top scorer Nick Boyd (13.2 PPG), one of Florida Atlantic's Final Four heroes from 2023, the Aztecs have forced turnovers on one-fifth of their Mountain West opponents' possessions this season. But Brian Dutcher's squad was also a middle-of-the-pack offensive team in league play, which could be a problem for the Aztecs.
Brian Dutcher's Aztecs have become a big bracket mainstay, this being their seventh NCAA Tournament-level season in Dutcher's eight years running the program. SDSU had an interesting resume, but it proved to be enough to squeak it into the field. Now that it's in, keep in mind: This team beat HOUSTON this season. It also claims a win over Creighton. The 'Tecs are as defensively aggressive as you remember, frequently holding opponents under 66, 67 points. The guy who's unlocked some potential here has Final Four experience: Former FAU guard Nick Boyd leads the team in scoring and assists.

North Carolina Tar Heels
North Carolina (ACC) has a record of 18-11 this season. They have a Net Rating of 17.24, ranking 39 overall. Their Offensive Rating (ORtg) is 119.4, ranking 26 in the nation, while their Defensive Rating (DRtg) is 102.1, ranking 76. The team's adjusted tempo (AdjT) is 71.0, indicating their pace of play. Their strength of schedule rating is 11.96, which ranks 28. Additionally, their luck rating is -0.003 (ranked 184).
From 1975 to 2009, North Carolina went to all but two NCAA tournaments. But the Tar Heels entered this year's ACC tournament facing the possibility that they might miss the Dance for a second time in three years -- an unprecedented moment for a program of their standing. These Tar Heels have not lived up to preseason expectations, even with RJ Davis (17.3 PPG), the nation's only returning AP first-team All-American. They have been mostly average since five-year standout Armando Bacot graduated, and Hubert Davis failed to sign another elite big man from the transfer portal in the offseason to replace him. They did win six of their last seven conference games and two ACC tournament games -- which also isn't saying much as this is one of the worst years for the ACC in recent memory. No matter what happens next, North Carolina appears to be at a crossroads.
The Tar Heels have made their way into the field and not without controversy. It's ultra-rare to have a team qualify despite just one Quad 1 win, but the 22 wins overall were enough. I remain baffled. But, they're here, so ... can they win a game against a tournament-level team? It basically falls on super senior RJ Davis, who will close out his career as a top-three all-time scorer in UNC history with Armando Bacot and Tyler Hansbrough.

VCU Rams
VCU (A10) has a record of 22-5 this season. They have a Net Rating of 20.44, ranking 31 overall. Their Offensive Rating (ORtg) is 116.4, ranking 51 in the nation, while their Defensive Rating (DRtg) is 96.0, ranking 22. The team's adjusted tempo (AdjT) is 66.7, indicating their pace of play. Their strength of schedule rating is 0.41, which ranks 141. Additionally, their luck rating is -0.058 (ranked 314).
Seven years ago, Ryan Odom's life changed when he led UMBC to an upset over Virginia, the first time a 16-seed defeated a 1-seed -- the No. 1 overall seed, too -- in NCAA tournament history. The 50-year-old head coach has had the Midas touch since. VCU is the third Division I and fourth collegiate program (including Division II Lenoir Rhyne) he has led to the NCAA tournament. The Rams, who own the Atlantic 10's best offense and defense, won their second conference tournament championship since 2015. Entering the Atlantic 10 tournament title game, the team held its opponents to a 44.7% clip inside the arc (11th in the country, per BartTorvik.com) since Luke Bamgboye (2.1 BPG) entered the starting lineup in late December.
Ryan Odom has VCU into the field after a 28-win season that included the A-10 title. It's the most wins for this program since 2011-12 under Shaka Smart. Odom has a pair of senior guards good for 15 per night who play so well off each other: Max Shulga and Joe Bamisile. They lead the attack with two more guards -- Zeb Jackson and Phillip Russell -- giving the Rams a four-guard approach that's a quirky change of pace from a lot of other teams in the bracket. This program is a March regular at this point: VCU is in the field for the 14th time since 2004.

Texas Longhorns
Texas (SEC) has a record of 16-11 this season. They have a Net Rating of 17.11, ranking 40 overall. Their Offensive Rating (ORtg) is 117.4, ranking 40 in the nation, while their Defensive Rating (DRtg) is 100.3, ranking 56. The team's adjusted tempo (AdjT) is 67.3, indicating their pace of play. Their strength of schedule rating is 11.35, which ranks 34. Additionally, their luck rating is -0.055 (ranked 307).
Similar to Oklahoma, Texas entered the SEC in a historic year for the league. The Longhorns had a 6-12 record in SEC play and won just five of 18 games against top-50 KenPom teams in the regular season. They lacked the quality wins the Sooners had accrued. And the loss to their rivals in the final game of the regular season was billed as an elimination game in the NCAA tournament conversation. Yet, they did enough in the SEC tournament to convince the selection committee to offer up an invitation. A sub-50 team in adjusted offensive and defensive efficiency, Texas does have Tre Johnson (20.2 PPG, 40% from beyond the arc), a 6-6 guard who is a projected lottery draft pick and will be a handful for any opponent.
There were a handful of teams that were sweating in the 48-72 hours leading up to Selection Sunday, and Texas was chief among them. With seven Quad 1 wins, resume metrics closer to 50 than 40 and three games under .500 in the top three quadrants, the Longhorns could have been left out. Instead, the high-end wins push them in despite 15 losses. Now that they're here, I've got two words for why you need to watch: Tre. Johnson. The freshman scorer is a potential top-five pick and liable to go for 30 if you give him enough daylight. Rodney Terry is also coaching for his job, adding to UT's urgency as it gets ready to play in Dayton.

Xavier Musketeers
Xavier (BE) has a record of 18-10 this season. They have a Net Rating of 15.43, ranking 52 overall. Their Offensive Rating (ORtg) is 114.5, ranking 67 in the nation, while their Defensive Rating (DRtg) is 99.0, ranking 46. The team's adjusted tempo (AdjT) is 69.3, indicating their pace of play. Their strength of schedule rating is 8.76, which ranks 58. Additionally, their luck rating is -0.015 (ranked 222).
From Jan. 28, 2023, to Nov. 4, 2024, 6-9 standout Zach Freemantle didn't play college basketball because of a lingering foot injury. "It gets pretty dark," Freemantle told reporters at Big East media day in the preseason. "You're watching your team every day. You're watching them lose. You're working out every day, but you're not doing what you want to do. It gets hard." But he has been healthy this season, which has been great news for Xavier. Freemantle averaged 19.8 PPG during the Musketeers' seven-game winning streak to end the regular season. And the X-men are now making their second trip to the NCAA tournament in three years under Sean Miller. They have also been one of America's top 3-point shooting teams (39%). This group beat UConn and Marquette in league play, and since Feb. 1 has also played top-25 defense.
The Musketeers are in! Sean Miller had never been on the bubble at any point in his two-decades-long head coaching career, and his first foray into the uncertainty goes his way after all. While we don't know for sure, it seems like not having key big man Zach Freemantle for two close losses vs. Marquette and UConn was something taken into consideration by the committee. Freemantle's good enough to play now, and he's key, but the guy to know is Ryan Conwell, one of the best pure scoring guards in college hoops. He had 38 vs. Marquette in the NCAA Tournament and will be ready to fire this week.

Drake Bulldogs
Drake (MVC) has a record of 25-3 this season. They have a Net Rating of 13.56, ranking 59 overall. Their Offensive Rating (ORtg) is 113.6, ranking 76 in the nation, while their Defensive Rating (DRtg) is 100.0, ranking 54. The team's adjusted tempo (AdjT) is 59.4, indicating their pace of play. Their strength of schedule rating is -0.16, which ranks 153. Additionally, their luck rating is 0.001 (ranked 174).
Just like the guy beefing with Kendrick Lamar, this Drake team has encountered adversity, with both head coach Darian DeVries (two-time Coach of the Year in the MVC) and his son Tucker (back-to-back MVC Player of the Year) leaving for West Virginia in the offseason. And yet, unlike the Canadian rapper, the Bulldogs found a way to succeed. Under first-year head coach Ben McCollum -- who came over from D-II and was named MVC Coach of the Year this season -- the Bulldogs won 30 games and earned legit Cinderella status ahead of the NCAA tournament. They've been a top-40ish defensive team since early January. They've also forced turnovers on 22% of their opponents' possessions over the past two months. Bennett Stirtz, who followed McCollum from D-II Northwest Missouri State, is a star. And they have a double-digit win over Vanderbilt, proof that they can compete with power-conference foes.
D-II Drake is one of the stories of the season in college hoops. Ben McCollum spent a decade-plus dominating at Northwest Missouri State, then immediately found huge success with the Bulldogs. The team is led by Bennett Stirtz, who's been one of the 20-or-so best players in the country. Stirtz averages 19.1 points, 5.7 assists, 4.1 rebounds and 2.2 steals. Drake beat Vanderbilt and Kansas State this season. It plays at a methodical pace and will be a super-trendy Cinderella pick. The school is in the NCAAs for a fourth time in five years with 136 victories in that span, making this one of the winningest programs in college basketball of the past half-decade.

UC San Diego Tritons
UC San Diego (BW) has a record of 24-4 this season. They have a Net Rating of 18.24, ranking 35 overall. Their Offensive Rating (ORtg) is 116.6, ranking 50 in the nation, while their Defensive Rating (DRtg) is 98.3, ranking 40. The team's adjusted tempo (AdjT) is 66.0, indicating their pace of play. Their strength of schedule rating is -1.55, which ranks 184. Additionally, their luck rating is -0.006 (ranked 193).
On Jan. 19, Saquon Barkley rushed for 205 yards in the Philadelphia Eagles' 28-22 win over the Los Angeles Rams in the NFL playoffs. That was also the last time UC San Diego lost a game. The Tritons enter the NCAA tournament on a 15-game winning streak, tied for the nation's longest, after defeating UC Irvine in the Big West tournament championship. Picked to finish third in the league's preseason poll, they instead won the Big West regular-season and conference tournament championships. Aniwaniwa Tait-Jones (19.7 PPG), a 6-6 guard from New Zealand, is the Big West Player of the Year and the leader of a team that finished with the league's top offense (57.1% shooting inside the arc) and defense (forcing turnovers on 23.7% of opponents' possessions in league play).
The Tritons! This is the program's fifth year in Division I and its first season of eligibility -- and it's in the bracket immediately. Eric Olen is the coach of a 30-win team that's ranked top-40 at KenPom for a month. The bosses of the Big West take nearly half of their shots from 3-point range and have good ball security. Not a lot of teams have a 6-foot-6 guy who's deployed at point guard, but that's exactly what senior Aniwaniwa Tait-Jones does in part-time duty with defensive specialist Hayden Grey, who leads the nation in steals. A very real threat to win at least one game, if not two.

Liberty Flames
Liberty (CUSA) has a record of 22-5 this season. They have a Net Rating of 12.15, ranking 69 overall. Their Offensive Rating (ORtg) is 109.8, ranking 130 in the nation, while their Defensive Rating (DRtg) is 97.7, ranking 34. The team's adjusted tempo (AdjT) is 65.5, indicating their pace of play. Their strength of schedule rating is -0.26, which ranks 155. Additionally, their luck rating is -0.01 (ranked 207).
Ritchie McKay's coaching career began as an assistant at Washington in 1988. Nearly 40 years later, he's enjoying his most fruitful chapter yet, in his second stint at Liberty (he was head coach from 2007 to 2009, too). The Flames on Saturday sealed their sixth conference regular-season championship in seven seasons with a 79-67 victory over Jacksonville State, with Kaden Metheny and Taelon Peter combining to score 41 points. Saturday's game was delayed for nearly an hour after a leaky roof during a major storm in Huntsville, Alabama, left officials scrambling. Once the teams returned to the floor, however, Liberty (No. 5 in 3-point shooting at 40%) finished 12-for-20 from beyond the arc.
The Flames have been in three conferences in the past eight years. They're the champions of C-USA, but two years ago were in the ASUN. Before that, the Big South. Ritchie McKay has been there the whole time, lifting his program to conference-champions status in four of those seasons. This team has the best overall shot selection of any in college basketball. With 6-4 senior Taelon Peter shooting 73.7% true shooting from the field, Liberty ranks No. 1 in effective field goal percentage (58.4%).

McNeese Cowboys
McNeese (Slnd) has a record of 23-6 this season. They have a Net Rating of 13.15, ranking 61 overall. Their Offensive Rating (ORtg) is 114.4, ranking 69 in the nation, while their Defensive Rating (DRtg) is 101.2, ranking 63. The team's adjusted tempo (AdjT) is 65.2, indicating their pace of play. Their strength of schedule rating is -2.03, which ranks 203. Additionally, their luck rating is -0.037 (ranked 276).
Three years ago, Will Wade was ostracized from the sport after LSU fired him following allegations of major NCAA violations. He has restored his career at McNeese, where he has led the program to 57 wins over two years and its second consecutive Southland tournament championship and NCAA tournament berth. McNeese swept all of the conference awards again, too: Coach of the Year (Wade), Player of the Year (Javohn Garcia, averaging 13.0 PPG and 1.5 SPG) and Defensive Player of the Year (Christian Shumate, averaging 1.3 BPG). In league play, McNeese had the best offense (39% from beyond the arc) and defense (forced turnovers on 22.4% of its opponents' possessions, per KenPom), too. All of this could lead to another high-major job offer for Wade, and soon.
Will Wade was exiled out of LSU a few years back, found a spot who would take him in McNeese and coached 'em up to back-to-back NCAA tourney appearances with a 57-10 overall record. The Cowboys are champs of the Southland and use a by-committee approach. Four guys average double figures, and this team doesn't have one particular forte, though it is good at keeping teams in third gear. Opponents average 64.0 points vs. the Pokes. Most indisposable player is senior SG Javohn Garcia.

Colorado State Rams
Colorado St. (MWC) has a record of 18-9 this season. They have a Net Rating of 12.57, ranking 64 overall. Their Offensive Rating (ORtg) is 114.3, ranking 70 in the nation, while their Defensive Rating (DRtg) is 101.8, ranking 70. The team's adjusted tempo (AdjT) is 66.2, indicating their pace of play. Their strength of schedule rating is 5.14, which ranks 85. Additionally, their luck rating is 0.018 (ranked 135).
After losing to New Mexico on Dec. 28, Colorado State lost just three games -- all to top-60 KenPom teams on the road -- and challenged the Lobos for the Mountain West regular-season championship. Niko Medved's team has also had one of the best offenses since New Year's Eve, shooting 58% from inside the arc (17th nationally) and 40% from 3 (sixth nationally). It was the third-best defensive team in the Mountain West, impressive considering the two best teams -- UNM and San Diego State -- are both top-20 nationally in adjusted defensive efficiency. If Colorado State continues to excel in the postseason, Nique Clifford, a 6-6 wing who's averaging 18.4 PPG, 9.7 RPG and 4.4 APG while connecting on 39% of his 3-point attempts, could become a household name.
What a coaching job by Niko Medved, who's brought the Rams dancing for the third time in the past four seasons. CSU is looking for its first NCAA win since 2013, and with Nique Clifford emerging as one of the 15 best players in college basketball over the past two months, it's going to have a chance. The Rams are destined to be a trendy upset pick in the first round, and understandably so. Clifford is averaging 19.0 points, 9.7 rebounds and 4.4 assists. He's probably a first-round NBA pick. Few teams playing better, and few guys looking hotter, over the past month than Clifford and the Rams.

Yale Bulldogs
Yale (Ivy) has a record of 18-6 this season. They have a Net Rating of 12.39, ranking 65 overall. Their Offensive Rating (ORtg) is 116.9, ranking 43 in the nation, while their Defensive Rating (DRtg) is 104.5, ranking 111. The team's adjusted tempo (AdjT) is 68.2, indicating their pace of play. Their strength of schedule rating is -3.31, which ranks 251. Additionally, their luck rating is -0.071 (ranked 326).
In 2017, the Ivy League decided to make the switch from awarding its regular-season champion the automatic berth to hosting its own tournament to determine its NCAA tournament representative. Since then, Princeton and Yale have won every season, except one (Penn, 2018). Which is why it's no surprise that Yale, the Ivy League regular-season champion, has secured its third NCAA tournament berth over the past four seasons under James Jones. Last season, the Bulldogs beat Auburn in the first round. And although the star of that team, Danny Wolf, transferred to Michigan, Bez Mbeng (13.4 PPG,. 5.4 RPG, 5.9 APG, 1.8 SPG) was named Ivy League Player of the Year -- and he's not even their top scorer. Guard John Poulakidas (19.3 PPG) and forward Nick Townsend (15.4 PPG) are also averaging double figures this season.
This is the Bulldogs' fifth NCAAs trip in the past 10 seasons, and in the previous four appearances, Yale had a 50% hit rate on first-round upsets. James Jones' program beat No. 5 Baylor in 2016, then upset fourth-seeded Auburn last year. Jones has been at Yale for 26 years, making him one of the longest-tenured coaches in college basketball and among the more respected, too. After losing key pieces Danny Wolf to Michigan and Matt Knowling to USC, Yale is still one of the better teams from a single-bid league (ranking top-75 at KenPom). Senior wing John Poulakidas has been outstanding this season and may have a big moment awaiting him this week.

Akron Zips
Akron (MAC) has a record of 21-6 this season. They have a Net Rating of 6.09, ranking 100 overall. Their Offensive Rating (ORtg) is 111.8, ranking 96 in the nation, while their Defensive Rating (DRtg) is 105.7, ranking 140. The team's adjusted tempo (AdjT) is 72.3, indicating their pace of play. Their strength of schedule rating is -3.9, which ranks 270. Additionally, their luck rating is 0.052 (ranked 72).
For the third time in four years, Akron coach John Groce has led his team to the NCAA tournament. But this trip might be bittersweet for the 53-year-old coach, who had to outduel his brother, Miami (Ohio) coach Travis Steele -- yes, his actual brother -- to win the MAC's automatic bid. Family drama aside, Akron has lost only one game since Dec. 30. During that 21-1 rally, the Zips have made 60% of their shots inside the arc (a top-three mark in America) and 38% of their 3-point attempts. They also won 11 conference games by double digits. With Nate Johnson -- the MAC Player of the Year who has scored 19 points or more in eight games this season -- Akron will be a tough matchup for any opponent in the field.
The Zips zipped into this tournament after coming back from 18 down in the MAC title game against Miami University and outscoring their opponents 15-4 in the final eight-plus minutes. Now, John Groce's program is in two straight tourneys for the first time in school history. A year ago, Akron had Enrique Freeman, one of the best mid-major players in the sport. They lost him, but they're back with a pair of junior-year Johnsons (Nate and Tavari) who average almost 30 points combined and keep Akron constantly in high gear.

High Point Panthers
High Point (BSth) has a record of 25-5 this season. They have a Net Rating of 9.02, ranking 87 overall. Their Offensive Rating (ORtg) is 119.3, ranking 27 in the nation, while their Defensive Rating (DRtg) is 110.3, ranking 227. The team's adjusted tempo (AdjT) is 66.6, indicating their pace of play. Their strength of schedule rating is -4.96, which ranks 295. Additionally, their luck rating is 0.007 (ranked 164).
This is the kind of dangerous double-digit seed that will give opposing coaches nightmares. After winning the Big South regular-season title a year ago, the Panthers fell short of a berth with an overtime loss to Longwood in the conference tournament semifinals. This year, however, they finished the job under second-year coach Alan Huss (Big South Coach of the Year) and won both the conference's regular-season championship and the tournament. Led by Kimani Hamilton (13.4 PPG) and Kezza Giffa (14.8 PPG), both all-Big South first-team selections, High Point enters the NCAA tournament with the nation's longest winning streak at 14 games. During the streak (they last lost two weeks before the Luka Doncic-Anthony Davis trade), the Panthers connected on 60% of their 2s and 37% of their 3s, per BartTorvik.com.
The Panthers are a veritable Cinderella candidate led by second-year coach Alan Huss, who guided his team to a 29-5 record as champs out of the Big South. High Point is riding a 14-game winning streak. The Panthers rank top-30 in adjusted offensive efficiency at KenPom, led by a guy with one of the best names in the field: Kezza Giffa (14.8 ppg).

Grand Canyon Lopes
Grand Canyon (WAC) has a record of 20-6 this season. They have a Net Rating of 6.11, ranking 99 overall. Their Offensive Rating (ORtg) is 106.5, ranking 195 in the nation, while their Defensive Rating (DRtg) is 100.4, ranking 57. The team's adjusted tempo (AdjT) is 72.0, indicating their pace of play. Their strength of schedule rating is -3.43, which ranks 257. Additionally, their luck rating is 0.03 (ranked 113).
Bryce Drew has lived a few lives. He made a miraculous shot to lead Valparaiso to a win over Ole Miss in the 1998 NCAA tournament. He played professionally in the NBA and overseas. Then he worked his way up to earn the Vanderbilt head coaching job in 2016-17 but was dismissed three seasons later. Today, he's one of the most consistent and successful non-power-conference coaches in the country. With Grand Canyon's win over Utah Valley in the WAC tournament championship game, Drew is now responsible for every WAC regular-season title (two) and WAC tournament championship (three) in the school's history. After last season's win over Saint Mary's in the first round of the NCAA tournament, all-WAC first-team selection Tyon Grant-Foster (14.6 PPG, 1.5 BPG) and a Grand Canyon team with a top-60 defense hope to advance again.
Run like an Antelope into the Dance! Run like an Antelope into the Dance! For the fourth time in five years, GCU is the champion of the WAC under Bryce Drew. The Lopes are 26-7 and one of the fastest teams in the tournament. TCU transfer JaKobe Coles came into this program, and the way Tyon Grant-Foster was willing to share the spotlight after being the team's best player last season? That's why this team is back on the big stage again.

Lipscomb Bisons
Lipscomb (ASun) has a record of 21-9 this season. They have a Net Rating of 9.57, ranking 85 overall. Their Offensive Rating (ORtg) is 113.4, ranking 78 in the nation, while their Defensive Rating (DRtg) is 103.8, ranking 101. The team's adjusted tempo (AdjT) is 66.2, indicating their pace of play. Their strength of schedule rating is -3.36, which ranks 253. Additionally, their luck rating is -0.046 (ranked 297).
Lennie Acuff, Lipscomb's 60-year-old coach, has found success at the NAIA, Division II and Division I levels. He's an eight-time Gulf South Conference (D-II) Coach of the Year. He has also made three trips to the Sweet 16 and two trips to the Elite Eight at the Division II level. This season, he has helped the Bisons -- yep, with an "s" -- reach the Division I NCAA tournament for just the second time in school history after winning the Atlantic Sun tournament. If we're being honest, there isn't a lot of convincing evidence to believe they'll advance. In their two matchups against power-conference teams this season, Arkansas and Kentucky, they lost by a combined 45 points. Then again, they've also been red-hot since Feb. 1 (11-1), making 57% of their shots inside the arc and 41% from beyond it.
It's not Bison, it's Bisons! Lipscomb is back in the field for the second time in school history. The top team in the ASUN (25-9), Lipscomb is coached by Lennie Acuff. The Bisons are experienced but lack size. They aren't a great rebounding team, but they also are hard to turn over. The team's top player is senior PF Jacob Ognacevic, who leads in scoring (20.1 ppg) and rebounding (8.1) in addition to being a 40.1% 3-point shooter.

Montana Grizzlies
Montana (BSky) has a record of 20-8 this season. They have a Net Rating of -1.27, ranking 180 overall. Their Offensive Rating (ORtg) is 111.4, ranking 99 in the nation, while their Defensive Rating (DRtg) is 112.7, ranking 276. The team's adjusted tempo (AdjT) is 67.4, indicating their pace of play. Their strength of schedule rating is -0.99, which ranks 170. Additionally, their luck rating is 0.207 (ranked 1).
If you're looking for possible Cinderellas, you should pay attention to teams that recently turned a corner. Montana fits that bill, winning 14 of its past 15 games. Travis DeCuire, who was a star for the Grizzlies in the early 1990s, has led his team to its third NCAA tournament appearance since he was hired in 2014. His starting lineup -- All-Big Sky first-team honoree Joe Pridgen, Brandon Whitney, Malik Moore, Kai Johnson and Te'Jon Sawyer -- has registered 125.7 points per 100 possessions. (For contrast: The Cleveland Cavaliers, the NBA's top offense, are at 121.8.) That output has flipped the Grizzlies into one of the country's top offensive units entering the tournament: Since Jan. 20, they have been a top-40 offense, making 60.9% of their shots inside the arc and 42.1% from beyond it -- both the No. 2 marks nationally at BartTorvik.com over that stretch.
We were due to see this school in the Big Dance again. The Griz are in the field for the first time in six years and the third time overall under 11th-year coach Travis DeCuire. The champs out of the Big Sky went 25-9 and have a guy who's all cash. Sophomore lead guard Money Williams (actual name!) averages 13.1 points and 3.1 assists as the head of the snake. These Bears have one loss since Jan. 18.

Troy Trojans
Troy (SB) has a record of 18-10 this season. They have a Net Rating of 4.66, ranking 110 overall. Their Offensive Rating (ORtg) is 107.8, ranking 170 in the nation, while their Defensive Rating (DRtg) is 103.2, ranking 90. The team's adjusted tempo (AdjT) is 65.9, indicating their pace of play. Their strength of schedule rating is -3.08, which ranks 239. Additionally, their luck rating is -0.03 (ranked 261).
In 2018, UT Arlington fired Scott Cross following a 12-year reign. The school said it needed new "energy," even though Cross had won 72 games in his last three seasons with the program and led it to its only NCAA tournament appearance in school history. This year, Cross led Troy, his new team, to a share of the Sun Belt regular-season title and the third NCAA tournament appearance in that school's history. Tayton Conerway, Sun Belt Player of the Year, has been Superman for a program that held its opponents to a 42.3% clip inside the arc (No. 5 in America) over the final month of the season. Meanwhile, UT Arlington has had just one 20-win season since Cross left. So it has all worked out for Cross, who is now with a Troy squad that has lost just one game since Feb. 8 and won its conference tournament games by an average of 16 points.
Only the third time this century the Trojans have made the NCAA tourney. This team ranks top-100 in multiple predictive metrics. Their coach is Scott Cross, who last coached in the Big Dance in 2008 when he was at UT Arlington. The Trojans are interesting: they rank fifth nationally in offensive rebounding but are in the bottom 70 on the defensive end. The go-to guy is senior combo guard Tayton Conerway, who has a quality stat line over the past 21 games: 14.3 ppg, 4.8 apg, 4.3 rpg, 2.9 spg.

UNC Wilmington Seahawks
UNC Wilmington (CAA) has a record of 22-7 this season. They have a Net Rating of 3.56, ranking 118 overall. Their Offensive Rating (ORtg) is 112.9, ranking 81 in the nation, while their Defensive Rating (DRtg) is 109.4, ranking 211. The team's adjusted tempo (AdjT) is 65.7, indicating their pace of play. Their strength of schedule rating is -4.27, which ranks 282. Additionally, their luck rating is 0.049 (ranked 77).
At just 38 years old, Takayo Siddle has had a strong start to his head coaching career. He won just seven games in his first year (2020-21) at UNCW, but followed that pandemic season with four consecutive campaigns of at least 21 wins, for a 99-victory tally punctuated with the program's first CAA tournament championship and NCAA tournament appearance in eight years. The Seahawks have been a top-60 offensive team (56% clip inside the arc) since Jan. 16, the start of a 15-2 stretch, according to BartTorvik.com. This berth is a major achievement for guard Donovan Newby (14.6 PPG) and his teammates. It could also be the last time Siddle coaches that roster: Expect offers this offseason for one of the top coaches in the country under the age of 40.
Takayo Siddle's Seahawks are 27-7 and the champs of the Coastal Athletic Association. This is the school's first NCAA appearance since 2017. Senior PG Donovan Newby is a sturdy, two-way point guard at the mid-major level averaging 14.6 points, 3.5 assists and orchestrating Siddle's ball-screen offense with aplomb. The Seahawks aren't deep but they are not short on experience.

Bryant Bulldogs
Bryant (AE) has a record of 17-11 this season. They have a Net Rating of -0.13, ranking 164 overall. Their Offensive Rating (ORtg) is 107.5, ranking 175 in the nation, while their Defensive Rating (DRtg) is 107.7, ranking 175. The team's adjusted tempo (AdjT) is 72.4, indicating their pace of play. Their strength of schedule rating is -5.93, which ranks 309. Additionally, their luck rating is -0.034 (ranked 270).
Thirty years ago, Phil Martelli began his coaching journey at St. Joseph's, where he led the Hawks to the Elite Eight (2004). In 2025, his son Phil Martelli Jr. will enjoy his first postseason run as Bryant's head coach. In just his second season in Smithfield, Martelli has led Bryant to the NCAA tournament for the second time since it first became eligible as a Division I team in 2012-13. He was named America East's Coach of the Year after the Bulldogs defeated opponents by an average of 12.8 points, holding them to 68.7 points per game (the league's No. 1 scoring defense). In the conference championship game, St. Bonaventure transfer Barry Evans -- America East Newcomer of the Year -- finished with 19 points and seven rebounds.
For only the second time in school history, Bryant is dancing. The America East champions went 23-11 and are 17-2 since the calendar flipped to 2025. Phil Martelli Jr. is the coach, carrying on the legacy from his father, who did big things for many years at Saint Joseph's. The Bulldogs are a low-major, but they've got size: all starters are 6-6 or taller, with senior wing Rafael Pinzon (39.5%) and junior forward Barry Evans (38.4%) ever-lurking threats from deep.

Robert Morris Colonials
Robert Morris (Horz) has a record of 22-8 this season. They have a Net Rating of 0.41, ranking 158 overall. Their Offensive Rating (ORtg) is 105.8, ranking 213 in the nation, while their Defensive Rating (DRtg) is 105.4, ranking 128. The team's adjusted tempo (AdjT) is 68.5, indicating their pace of play. Their strength of schedule rating is -6.34, which ranks 315. Additionally, their luck rating is 0.084 (ranked 32).
Twelve years ago, Andy Toole led Robert Morris to an NIT victory over Kentucky, a year after the John Calipari-led Wildcats won the national title. This year, the Horizon League Coach of the Year snapped the program's 10-year NCAA tournament drought, with Alvaro Folgueiras, a 6-9 forward and league Player of the Year (14.3 PPG, 42% from 3) anchoring the Colonials' 10-game winning streak entering Selection Sunday. On EvanMiya.com, Folgueiras' BPR -- a measurement of a player's impact on offense and defense when he's on the court -- is higher than that of Georgia star Asa Newell, Memphis star PJ Haggerty and projected lottery draft pick Ace Bailey (Rutgers). Folgueiras could also be the catalyst for another Horizon League postseason victory: The conference has claimed an NCAA tournament win in two of the past three editions.
The Colonials wear the crown out of the Horizon League with a 26-8 record. Their coach is Andy Toole, who has brought RMU to the NCAAs for the second time (2015). RMU has four guys who average double figures, led by senior point guard Kam Woods (15.1 ppg). The team is hot; it has one loss (at that one by two points) since Feb. 8, going 16-1 in that stretch.

Wofford Terriers
Wofford (SC) has a record of 15-14 this season. They have a Net Rating of 2.53, ranking 134 overall. Their Offensive Rating (ORtg) is 112.0, ranking 94 in the nation, while their Defensive Rating (DRtg) is 109.4, ranking 213. The team's adjusted tempo (AdjT) is 64.1, indicating their pace of play. Their strength of schedule rating is 0.28, which ranks 143. Additionally, their luck rating is -0.039 (ranked 285).
A 51-point loss at Duke on Nov. 16 was Wofford's worst of the season. But in that game, Corey Tripp, a 6-3 point guard, and Kyler Filewich, a 6-9 center, combined to score 24 points (9-for-15) in the defeat to one of America's best. Perhaps those stats gave the duo confidence, because Tripp earned all-Southern Conference second-team honors and Filewich all-Southern Conference third-team honors on the way to leading Wofford to its first conference tournament championship and NCAA tournament appearance since 2019. The Terriers were hot and cold in conference action and never won more than three games in a row. During the SoCon tournament, however, they made 44% of their 3s -- an improvement from 34% in league play. They were also dominant down the stretch, and won their conference tournament games by an average of 13 points.
The Terriers only had two winning streaks of three games this season: in early January and last week in the SoCon bracket. The Terriers were the 6-seed out of the SoCon, marking the first time since 2014 that a top-four team in that league failed to win the autobid. (When it was Wofford.) In fact, this is the sixth different team in as many years to win the league tourney. Dwight Perry took over a tough situation two years ago and has done a nice job. Better keep a bogey on junior Justin Bailey: he averages 44.1% from 3 and is very particular about his shot selection.

Omaha Mavericks
Omaha (Sum) has a record of 18-12 this season. They have a Net Rating of -2.07, ranking 190 overall. Their Offensive Rating (ORtg) is 111.1, ranking 105 in the nation, while their Defensive Rating (DRtg) is 113.1, ranking 290. The team's adjusted tempo (AdjT) is 67.8, indicating their pace of play. Their strength of schedule rating is -1.99, which ranks 199. Additionally, their luck rating is 0.08 (ranked 36).
Omaha left no doubt about its status as the Summit League's representative in the NCAA tournament with its 85-75 victory over St. Thomas-Minnesota in the conference championship game. Entering the matchup, it had already earned the NCAA tournament berth because St. Thomas is still going through its four-year Division I transition and not yet eligible. Now that the Mavericks are in the field, they will be easy to root for in their first Division I NCAA tournament appearance. Picked to finish eighth in the nine-team Summit League, they have Marquel Sutton, a 6-8 forward who averaged 19.1 PPG and 8.0 RPG on the way to being named the conference Player of the Year. Don't be surprised if you see news of head coach Chris Crutchfield, the Summit League Coach of the Year, being pursued by schools with open jobs this offseason.
The Mavericks, coached by alum Chris Crutchfield, went 22-12 and won the Summit League. Senior F Marquel Sutton leads the team in points (19.1) and rebounds per game (8.0). The program's claim to fame this season is dirty: The team destroys whatever trash can is in sight after a big win. If Omaha can pull off an upset this week, it will be the most anticipated locker room celebration of the first round.

St. Francis (PA) Red Flash
Saint Francis (NEC) has a record of 12-17 this season. They have a Net Rating of -13.83, ranking 321 overall. Their Offensive Rating (ORtg) is 101.7, ranking 283 in the nation, while their Defensive Rating (DRtg) is 115.5, ranking 326. The team's adjusted tempo (AdjT) is 67.2, indicating their pace of play. Their strength of schedule rating is -5.7, which ranks 303. Additionally, their luck rating is 0.019 (ranked 133).
Every year the field is stacked with storylines worthy of a Disney movie. But head coach Rob Krimmel and his Red Flash are the most interesting. Let us explain: Krimmel was a guard for St. Francis (1996-2000) who shot 40% from the 3-point line. Then he became an assistant coach at his alma mater for the next 12 years. Then he was hired as head coach in 2012. He has since worked to lead his team back to the NCAA tournament for the first time since 1991. This season, after nearly three decades with this program, he has achieved his dream. Riley Parker (13.6 PPG, 40% from 3) leads a group that upset the favorite to win the NEC tournament championship -- extending a six-game winning streak -- after being picked to finish last in the conference entering 2024-25.
Amazingly, the NEC has had eight different teams win its league tournament in the past nine years. What a sweet story this team is. Sure, the Red Flash are sub-.500, but they're eminently likable. They're coached by a guy named Rob Krimmel, who was a standout shooting guard at the school from 1996-00. He's been coaching at the tiny university ever since, leading as the head coach for 13 years. This is the program's second NCAA trip ever, its first since 1991. No team in the tourney has a story quite like this, and it's why this tournament is perfectly sized and beautifully built. It's great to have you back at the party, SFU.

Alabama State Hornets
Alabama St. (SWAC) has a record of 13-15 this season. They have a Net Rating of -11.97, ranking 305 overall. Their Offensive Rating (ORtg) is 102.1, ranking 270 in the nation, while their Defensive Rating (DRtg) is 114.1, ranking 308. The team's adjusted tempo (AdjT) is 68.1, indicating their pace of play. Their strength of schedule rating is -7.85, which ranks 346. Additionally, their luck rating is 0.023 (ranked 126).
Along with Penny Hardaway, another member of Memphis's 1992 Elite Eight group will coach in this season's NCAA tournament. Tony Madlock averaged 9.4 points and started all 34 games for those Tigers, and, while his 2024-25 Hornets don't have the same overwhelming talent, he guided them to a massive season turnaround. The Hornets were 9-14 overall and 5-5 in the SWAC on Feb. 8, and then they won 10 of their next 11. Madlock will enjoy this tournament trip with his son, starter and all-SWAC second team selection TJ Madlock (12.0 points, 7.0 rebounds per game). This is also the Hornets' first tournament appearance since 2011.
The Hornets are the champs of the SWAC and in the field for the first time in 14 years. Coach Tony Madlock has done a great job there, turning the program around in just three seasons. Amarr Knox, a sophomore point guard, plays alongside senior CJ Hines. They're a great tandem in shot selection, distribution and a reliable handle. It's hard to turn those two over. This team does have a win over the field: It beat Omaha in November.

Mount St. Mary's Mountaineers
Mount St. Mary's (MAAC) has a record of 17-10 this season. They have a Net Rating of -7.69, ranking 256 overall. Their Offensive Rating (ORtg) is 101.3, ranking 288 in the nation, while their Defensive Rating (DRtg) is 109.0, ranking 204. The team's adjusted tempo (AdjT) is 68.1, indicating their pace of play. Their strength of schedule rating is -7.14, which ranks 337. Additionally, their luck rating is 0.154 (ranked 4).
Donny Lind was the video coordinator for VCU when the Rams made their miraculous run to the Final Four in 2011. The 38-year-old head coach has now pulled off a few upsets of his own in his first season in Frederick County, including leading the Mountaineers to their first conference title in five years. Mount St. Mary's finished in a tie for fourth place in the regular season but defeated Marist and Merrimack in the conference tournament quarterfinals and semifinals, respectively, before taking down Iona in the title game. Arlandus Keyes, a 6-foot-2 guard, missed three games prior to the MAAC tournament because of injury. But he was the star in the tournament, averaging 12.7 points and shooting 47% from 3.
The first 6-seed in MAAC Tournament history to win the auto bid, say hello again to the Mountaineers of Mount St. Mary's. The program is in the field for the seventh time in program history, all previous trips being as a No. 16 seed. Junior forward Dola Adebayo is at his best in the paint. This is the second team in this tournament that has a head coach who started out as a team manager in college. Michigan's Dusty May did so at Indiana, while the Mount's Donny Lind got his start at Loyola Maryland under the never-shy Jimmy Patsos.

American University Eagles
American (PL) has a record of 18-11 this season. They have a Net Rating of -7.0, ranking 247 overall. Their Offensive Rating (ORtg) is 103.3, ranking 247 in the nation, while their Defensive Rating (DRtg) is 110.3, ranking 228. The team's adjusted tempo (AdjT) is 63.6, indicating their pace of play. Their strength of schedule rating is -5.92, which ranks 308. Additionally, their luck rating is 0.137 (ranked 8).
Matt Rogers saved his best for last. In his first two years at American, the 6-9 center was a combined 2-for-24 from beyond the arc. Now, in his fifth season, he's a certified sharpshooter (41%) who averaged 16.8 PPG and 5.5 RPG and was named to the all-Patriot League first team. He had 25 points in the tournament championship victory over Navy that earned the Eagles their fourth Division I NCAA tournament appearance, and their first since 2014. His emergence is one of the country's greatest stories for a player. American's success is also significant for coach Duane Simpkins, who arrived in D.C. last season and has his group shooting 76.1% from the free throw line.
Does anyone else feel like tossing on a heavy crew shirt and cargo shorts? The American Eagles are back in the Big Dance for the first time since 2014. Coach Duane Simpkins oversees a methodical offense, ranking near the bottom in pace, but don't take that to mean this team is a slog. It averages 68.7 points, senior forward Matt Rogers (17.0 ppg) carrying the biggest portion of the load.

SIU Edwardsville Cougars
SIUE (OVC) has a record of 19-10 this season. They have a Net Rating of -5.37, ranking 230 overall. Their Offensive Rating (ORtg) is 101.8, ranking 281 in the nation, while their Defensive Rating (DRtg) is 107.2, ranking 166. The team's adjusted tempo (AdjT) is 66.2, indicating their pace of play. Their strength of schedule rating is -9.66, which ranks 360. Additionally, their luck rating is 0.04 (ranked 94).
There are a lot of stories about this one. Coach Brian Barone hung a pair of scissors above the team's locker room when he was hired in 2019, in anticipation of the moment he and his team experienced last week when they won the Ohio Valley Conference tournament championship and made history. On top of that, SIUE's success has been a family affair: 6-1 guard Ray'Sean Taylor was named OVC Player of the Year and finished with 20 points, 7 rebounds and 4 assists in the 69-48 victory over Southeast Missouri in the conference tournament title game. His cousin, Brian Taylor II, earned a spot on the all-OVC second team after averaging 12.0 PPG. He is also one of America's top shooters (47% from 3). This has been an incredible run for SIUE, which is making its first Division I NCAA tournament appearance, 17 years after it made the transition from Division II.
The Cougars are also dancing for the first time. Coach Brian Barone has more than paid his dues to this point, but beyond that, there's a great story here. Senior guard Ray'Sean Taylor (the school's all-time leading scorer) has stuck with this program for four years. He's scored 1,952 points, placing him fourth among all active four-year players at one school in Division I. He only ranks behind Saint Joseph's Erik Reynolds, Texas A&M's Wade Taylor IV and Marquette's Kam Jones. This is a tall team for a No. 16 seed, with four starters averaging around 6-foot-7 and a 6-11 center off the bench.

Norfolk State Spartans
Norfolk St. (MEAC) has a record of 20-8 this season. They have a Net Rating of -0.79, ranking 174 overall. Their Offensive Rating (ORtg) is 108.4, ranking 157 in the nation, while their Defensive Rating (DRtg) is 109.1, ranking 208. The team's adjusted tempo (AdjT) is 66.6, indicating their pace of play. Their strength of schedule rating is -6.88, which ranks 328. Additionally, their luck rating is 0.062 (ranked 58).
It was a wild finish in Norfolk State's 66-65 win over South Carolina State for the MEAC tournament title: SC State's Caleb McCarty tied the score but didn't realize it, then immediately committed a foul, putting Norfolk State at the free throw line in the final seconds. That shouldn't diminish what Robert Jones III's team has accomplished this season. This is the Spartans' third trip to the NCAA tournament in the past five years. Brian Moore Jr. (18.5 PPG, 41% from 3) is one of the best players Jones has had on his roster during his 12-year tenure. This season alone, Moore has had eight games with at least 24 points. Overall, the team has shot 57% from inside the arc during MEAC play. It has also won 12 of its past 14 contests.
For 11 seasons, Robert Jones has done as good of a job as you could ever ask of someone at Norfolk State. The school has four NCAA Tournament appearances in its history with three of them coming under Jones. The MEAC champs are a long shot to pull an upset because they aren't good at shooting the 3 and they aren't prone to taking a lot. That said, they make up for it with plenty of players who have good touch from the midrange, the best of them being 6-8 senior Jalen Myers, who is a 60% shooter from 2-point range.
