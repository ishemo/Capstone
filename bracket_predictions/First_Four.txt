Team61 (Seed 16) vs Team62 (Seed 16) -> I predict that Team62 would win with a score of 75-65.
Team63 (Seed 16) vs Team64 (Seed 16) -> Based on their respective seeds, it is likely that Team63 and Team64 would be evenly matched and it would be a close game. However, based on their performance in the regular season and any other factors, it is difficult to make an accurate prediction at this time. It would be best to wait until closer to the tournament to make a more informed prediction.
Team65 (Seed 11) vs Team66 (Seed 11) -> I predict that Team65 (Seed 11) would win with a final score of 75-70.
Team67 (Seed 11) vs Team68 (Seed 11) -> Based on their seedings, it is likely that Team67 and Team68 would be evenly matched in terms of talent and skill. Both teams would have fought hard to make it to the tournament, and it would be difficult to predict a clear winner.

However, if I had to make a prediction, I would say that Team67 has a slight advantage over Team68. They may have a slightly stronger record and more experience in high-pressure situations. I predict that Team67 would win by a close margin, with a final score of 70-68.
