Since both teams are identical in your provided scenario, the game's outcome is impossible to predict accurately. However, if we must choose, we could say that Indiana wins, since that's the only team mentioned. The score can't be predicted accurately due to the teams being identical. So for the sake of the exercise, let's say Indiana, 75-70.
Marquette, 75-70
